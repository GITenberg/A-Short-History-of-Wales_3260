xi</span>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">This</span> little book is meant for those
who have never read any Welsh history before.&nbsp; It is not
taken for granted that the reader knows either Latin or
Welsh.</p>
<p>A fuller outline may be read in <i>The Story of Wales</i>, in
the &ldquo;Story of the Nations&rdquo; series; and a still fuller
one in <i>The Welsh People</i> of Rhys and Brynmor Jones.&nbsp;
Of fairly small and cheap books in various periods I may mention
Rhys&rsquo; <i>Celtic Britain</i>, Owen Rhoscomyl&rsquo;s
<i>Flame Bearers of Welsh History</i>, Henry Owen&rsquo;s
<i>Gerald the Welshman</i>, Bradley&rsquo;s <i>Owen
Glendower</i>, Newell&rsquo;s <i>Welsh Church</i>, and Rees
<i>Protestant Non-conformity in Wales</i>.&nbsp; More elaborate
and expensive books are Seebohm&rsquo;s <i>Village Community</i>
and <i>Tribal System in Wales</i>, Clark&rsquo;s <i>Medieval
Military Architecture</i>, Morris&rsquo; <i>Welsh Wars of Edward
I.</i>, <a name="pagexii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xii</span>Southall&rsquo;s <i>Wales and Her Language</i>.&nbsp;
In writing local history, A. N. Palmer&rsquo;s <i>History of
Wrexham</i> and companion volumes are models.</p>
<p>If you turn to a library, you will find much information about
Wales in <i>Social England</i>, the <i>Dictionary of National
Biography</i>, the publications of the Cymmrodorion and other
societies.&nbsp; You will find articles of great value and
interest over the names of F. H. Haverfield, J. W. Willis-Bund,
Egerton Phillimore, the Honourable Mrs Bulkeley Owen
(<i>Gwenrhian Gwynedd</i>), Henry Owen, the late David Lewis, T.
F. Tout, J. E. Lloyd, D. Lleufer Thomas, W. Llywelyn Williams, J.
Arthur Price, J. H. Davies, J. Ballinger, Edward Owen, Hubert
Hall, Hugh Williams, R. A. Roberts, A. W. Wade-Evans, E. A.
Lewis.&nbsp; These are only a few out of the many who are now
working in the rich and unexplored field of Welsh history.&nbsp;
I put down the names only of those I had to consult in writing a
small book like this.</p>
<p><a name="pagexiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xiii</span>The
sources are mostly in Latin or Welsh.&nbsp; Many volumes of
chronicles, charters, and historical poems have been published by
the Government, by the Corporation of Cardiff, by J. Gwenogvryn
Evans, by H. de Grey Birch, and others.&nbsp; But, so far, we
have not had the interesting chronicles and poems translated into
English as they ought to be, and published in well edited, not
too expensive volumes.</p>

<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>I<br />
WALES</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Wales</span> is a row of hills, rising
between the Irish Sea on the west and the English plains on the
east.&nbsp; If you come from the west along the sea, or if you
cross the Severn or the Dee from the east, you will see that
Wales is a country all by itself.&nbsp; It rises grandly and
proudly.&nbsp; If you are a stranger, you will think of it as
&ldquo;Wales&rdquo;&mdash;a strange country; if you are Welsh,
you will think of it as &ldquo;Cymru&rdquo;&mdash;a land of
brothers.</p>
<p>The geologist will tell you how Wales was made; the geographer
will tell you what it is like now; the historian will tell you
what its people have done and what they are.&nbsp; All <a
name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>three will tell
you that it is a very interesting country.</p>
<p>The rocks of Wales are older and harder than the rocks of the
plains; and as you travel from the south to the north, the older
and harder they become.&nbsp; The highest mountains of Wales, and
some of its hills, have crests of the very oldest and hardest
rock&mdash;granite, porphyry, and basalt; and these rocks are
given their form by fire.&nbsp; But the greater part of the
country is made of rocks formed by water&mdash;still the oldest
of their kind.&nbsp; In the north-west, centre, and
west&mdash;about two-thirds of the whole country,&mdash;the rocks
are chiefly slate and shale; in the south-east they are chiefly
old red sandstone; in the north-east, but chiefly in the south,
they are limestone and coal.</p>
<p>Its rocks give Wales its famous scenery&mdash;its rugged
peaks, its romantic glens, its rushing rivers.&nbsp; They are
also its chief wealth&mdash;granite, slate, limestone, coal; and
lodes of still more precious metals&mdash;iron, lead, silver, and
gold&mdash;run through them.</p>
<p>The highest mountain in Wales is Snowdon, which is 3,570 feet
above the level of the sea.&nbsp; For every 300 feet we go up,
the temperature becomes one degree cooler.&nbsp; At about 1,000
feet it becomes too <a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span>cold for wheat; at about 1,500 it becomes too cold for
corn; at about 2,000 it is too cold for cattle; mountain ponies
graze still higher; the bleak upper slopes are left to the small
and valuable Welsh sheep.</p>
<p>There are three belts of soil around the hills&mdash;arable,
pasture, and sheep-run&mdash;one above the other.&nbsp; The
arable land forms about a third of the country; it lies along the
sea border, on the slopes above the Dee and the Severn, and in
the deep valleys of the rivers which pierce far inland,&mdash;the
Severn, Wye, Usk, Towy, Teivy, Dovey, Conway, and Clwyd.&nbsp;
The pasture land, the land of small mountain farms, forms the
middle third; it is a land of tiny valleys and small plains, ever
fostered by the warm, moist west wind.&nbsp; Above it, the
remaining third is stormy sheep-run, wide green slopes and wild
moors, steep glens and rocky heights.</p>
<p>From north-west to south-east the line of high hills
runs.&nbsp; In the north-west corner, Snowdon towers among a
number of heights over 3,000 feet.&nbsp; At its feet, to the
north-west, the isle of Anglesey lies.&nbsp; The peninsula of
Lleyn, with a central ridge of rock, and slopes of pasture lands,
runs to the south-west.&nbsp; To the east, beyond the Conway, <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>lie the
Hiraethog mountains, with lower heights and wider reaches;
further east again, over the Clwyd, are the still lower hills of
Flint.</p>
<p>To the south, 30 miles as the crow flies, over the slate
country, the Berwyns are seen clearly.&nbsp; From a peak among
these&mdash;Cader Vronwen (2,573 feet), or the Aran (2,970 feet),
or Cader Idris (2,929 feet)&mdash;we look east and south, over
the hilly slopes of the upper Severn country.</p>
<p>Another 30 miles to the south rises green Plinlimmon (2,469
feet); from it we see the high moorlands of central Wales,
sloping to Cardigan Bay on the west and to the valley of the
Severn, now a lordly English river, on the east.</p>
<p>Forty miles south the Black Mountain (2,630 feet) rises beyond
the Wye, and the Brecon Beacons (2,910 feet) beyond the
Usk.&nbsp; West of these the hills fade away into the broad
peninsula of Dyved.&nbsp; Southwards we look over hills of coal
and iron to the pleasant sea-fringed plain of Gwent.</p>
<p>On the north and the west the sea is shallow; in some places
it is under 10 fathoms for 10 miles from the shore, and under 20
fathoms for 20 miles.&nbsp; Tales of drowned lands are
told&mdash;of the sands of <a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>Lavan, of the feast of drunken
Seithenyn, and of the bells of Aberdovey.&nbsp; But the sea is a
kind neighbour.&nbsp; Its soft, warm winds bathe the hills with
life; and the great sweep of the big Atlantic waves into the
river mouths help our commerce.&nbsp; Holyhead, Milford Haven,
Swansea, Newport, Barry, and Cardiff&mdash;now one of the chief
ports of the world&mdash;can welcome the largest vessels
afloat.&nbsp; The herring is plentiful on the west coast, and
trout and salmon in the rivers.</p>
<h2>II<br />
THE WANDERING NATIONS</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">By</span> land and by sea, race after race
has come to make the hills of Wales its home.&nbsp; One race
would be short, with dark eyes and black hair; another would be
tall, with blue eyes and fair hair.&nbsp; They came from
different countries and along different paths, but each race
brought some good with it.&nbsp; One brought skill in taming
animals, until it had at last tamed even the pig and the bee;
another brought iron tools to take the <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>place of stone ones.&nbsp; Another
brought the energy of the chase and war, and another a delight in
sailing a ship or in building a fortress.</p>
<p>One thing they had in common&mdash;they wandered, and they
wandered to the west.&nbsp; From the cold wastes and the dark
forests of the north and east, they were ever pushing west to
more sunny lands.&nbsp; As far back as we can see, the great
migration of nations to the west was going on.&nbsp; The islands
of Britain were the furthest point they could reach; for beyond
it, at that time, no man had dared to sail into the unknown
expanse of the ocean of the west.&nbsp; In the islands of
Britain, the mountains of Wales were among the most difficult to
win, and it was only the bravest and the hardiest that could make
their home among them.</p>
<p>The first races that came were short and dark.&nbsp; They came
in tribes.&nbsp; They had tribal marks, the picture of an animal
as a rule; and they had a strange fancy that this animal was
their ancestor.&nbsp; It may be that the local nicknames which
are still remembered&mdash;such as &ldquo;the pigs of
Anglesey,&rdquo; &ldquo;the dogs of Denbigh,&rdquo; &ldquo;the
cats of Ruthin,&rdquo; &ldquo;the crows of Harlech,&rdquo;
&ldquo;the gadflies of Mawddwy&rdquo;&mdash;were the proud tribe
<a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>titles of
these early people.&nbsp; Their weapons and tools were polished
stone; their hammers and hatchets and adzes, their lance heads
and their arrow tips, were of the hardest igneous
rock&mdash;chipped and ground with patient labour.</p>
<p>The people who come first have the best chance of staying, if
only they are willing to learn; hardy plants will soon take the
place of tender plants if left alone.&nbsp; The short dark people
are still the main part, not only of the Welsh, but of the
British people.&nbsp; It is true that their language has
disappeared, except a few place-names.&nbsp; But languages are
far more fleeting than races.&nbsp; The loss of its language does
not show that a race is dead; it only shows that it is very
anxious to change and learn.&nbsp; Some languages easily give
place to others, and we say that the people who speak these
languages are good linguists, like Danes and Slavs.&nbsp; Other
languages persist, those who speak them are unwilling to speak
any new language, and this is the reason why Spanish and English
are so widespread.</p>
<p>After the short dark race came a tall fair-haired
people.&nbsp; They came in families as well as in tribes.&nbsp;
They had iron weapons and tools, and the short dark people could
<a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>not keep
them at bay with their bone-tipped spears and flint-headed
arrows.&nbsp; We know nothing about the struggle between
them.&nbsp; But it may be that the fairy stories we were told
when children come from those far-off times.&nbsp; If a fairy
maiden came from lake or mound to live among men, she vanished at
once if touched with iron.&nbsp; Is this, learned men have asked,
a dim memory of the victory of iron over stone?</p>
<p>The name given to the short dark man is usually Iberian; the
name given to the tall fair man who followed him is Celt.&nbsp;
The two learnt to live together in the same country.&nbsp; The
conqueror probably looked upon himself at first as the master of
the conquered, then as simply belonging to a superior race, but
gradually the distinction vanished.&nbsp; The language remained
the language of the Celt; it is called an Aryan language, a
language as noble among languages as the Aran is among its
hills.&nbsp; It is still spoken in Wales, in Brittany, in
Ireland, in the Highlands of Scotland, and in the Isle of
Man.&nbsp; It was also spoken in Cornwall till the eighteenth
century; and Yorkshire dalesmen still count their sheep in
Welsh.&nbsp; English is another Aryan tongue.</p>
<p><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>The more
mixed a nation is, the more rich its life and the greater its
future.&nbsp; Purity of blood is not a thing to boast of, and no
great and progressive nation comes from one breed of men.&nbsp;
Some races have more imagination than others, or a finer feeling
for beauty; others have more energy and practical wisdom.&nbsp;
The best nations have both; and they have both, probably, because
many races have been blended in their making.&nbsp; There is
hardly a parish in Wales in which there are not different types
of faces and different kinds of character.</p>
<p>The wandering of nations has never really stopped.&nbsp; The
Celt was followed by his cousins&mdash;the Angle and the
Saxon.&nbsp; These, again, were followed by races still more
closely related to them&mdash;the Normans and the Danes and the
Flemings.&nbsp; They have all left their mark on Wales and on the
Welsh character.</p>
<p>The migration is still going on.&nbsp; Trace the history of an
upland Welsh parish, and you will find that, in a surprisingly
short time, the old families, high and low, have given place to
newcomers.&nbsp; Look into the trains which carry emigrants from
Hull or London to Liverpool on their way west&mdash;they have the
blue eyes and yellow hair of <a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>those who came two thousand years
ago.&nbsp; But this country is no longer their goal, the great
continent of America has been discovered beyond.&nbsp; Fits of
longing for wandering come over the Welsh periodically, as they
came over the Danes&mdash;caused by scarcity of food and density
of population, or by a sense of oppression and a yearning for
freedom.&nbsp; An empty stomach sometimes, and sometimes a fiery
imagination, sent a crowd of adventurers to new lands.&nbsp; And
it is thus that every living nation is ever renewing its
youth.</p>
<h2>III<br />
ROME</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is not a spirit of adventure and
daring alone that makes a nation.&nbsp; Rome rose to say that it
must have the spirit of order and law too.&nbsp; It rose in the
path of the nations; it built the walls of its empire, guarded by
the camps of its legions, right across it.&nbsp; For four hundred
years the wandering of nations ceased; the nations
stopped&mdash;and they began to till the ground, to live in
cities, to form <a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>states.&nbsp; The hush of this peace did not last, but
the memory of it remained in the life of every nation that felt
it.&nbsp; Unity and law tempered freedom and change.</p>
<p>The name of Rome was made known, and made terrible, through
Wales by a great battle fought on the eastern slopes of the
Berwyn.&nbsp; The Romans had conquered the lands beyond the
Severn, and had placed themselves firmly near the banks of that
river at Glevum and Uriconium.&nbsp; Glevum is our Gloucester,
and its streets are still as the Roman architect planned
them.&nbsp; Uriconium is the burnt and buried city beyond
Shrewsbury; the skulls found in it, and its implements of
industry, and the toys of its children, you can see in the
Shrewsbury Museum.</p>
<p>The British leader in the great battle was Caratacus, the
general who had fought the Romans step by step until he had come
to the borders of Wales, to summon the warlike Silures to save
their country.&nbsp; We do not know the site of the great battle,
though the Roman historian Tacitus gives a graphic description of
it.&nbsp; The Britons were on a hill side sloping down to a
river, and the Romans could only attack them in front.&nbsp; The
enemy waded the river, however, and scaled the wall on its
further bank; and in the fierce lance <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>and sword fight the host of Caratacus
lost the day.&nbsp; He fled, but was afterwards handed over to
the Romans, and taken to Rome, to grace the triumphal procession
of the victors.</p>
<p>The battle only roused the Silures to a more fierce
resistance, and it cost the Romans many lives, and it took them
many years, to break their power.&nbsp; The strangest sight that
met the invaders was in Anglesey, after they had crossed the
Menai on horses or on rafts.&nbsp; The druids tried to terrify
them by the rites of their religion.&nbsp; The dark groves, the
women dressed in black and carrying flaming torches, the aged
priests&mdash;the sight paralysed the Roman soldiers, but only
for a moment.</p>
<p>Vespasian&mdash;it was he who sent his son Titus to besiege
Jerusalem&mdash;became emperor in 69.&nbsp; The war was carried
on with great energy, and by 78 Wales was entirely conquered.</p>
<p>Then Agricola, a wise ruler, came.&nbsp; The peace of Rome was
left in the land; and the Welshman took the Roman, not willingly
at first, as his teacher and ruler instead of as his enemy.&nbsp;
Towns were built; the two Chesters or Caerlleons (Castra
Legionum), on the Dee and the Usk, being the most important from
a military point of view.&nbsp; <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>Roads were made; two along the north
and south coasts, to Carmarthen and Carnarvon; two others ran
parallel along the length of Wales, to connect their ends.&nbsp;
On these roads towns rose; and some, like Caerwent, were
self-governing communities of prosperous people.&nbsp;
Agriculture flourished; the Welsh words for &ldquo;plough&rdquo;
and &ldquo;cheese&rdquo; are &ldquo;aradr&rdquo; and
&ldquo;caws&rdquo;&mdash;the Latin <i>aratrum</i> and
<i>caseus</i>.&nbsp; The mineral wealth of the country was
discovered; and copper mines and lead mines, silver mines and
gold mines, were worked.&nbsp; The &ldquo;aur&rdquo; (gold) and
&ldquo;arian&rdquo; (silver) and &ldquo;plwm&rdquo; (lead) of the
Welshman are the Latin <i>aurum</i>, <i>argentum</i>, and
<i>plumbum</i>.</p>
<p>The Romans allowed the Welsh families and tribes to remain as
before, and to be ruled by their own kings and chiefs.&nbsp; But
they kept the defence of the country&mdash;the manning of the
great wall in the north of Roman Britain, the garrisoning of the
legion towns, and the holding of the western sea&mdash;in their
own hand.</p>
<p>Gradually the power of Rome began to wane, and its hold on
distant countries like Britain began to relax.&nbsp; The
wandering nations were gathering on its eastern and northern
borders, and its walls and legions <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>at last gave way.&nbsp; It had not
been a kind mother to the nations it had conquered&mdash;in war
it had been cruel, and in peace it had been selfish and
stern.&nbsp; The lust of rule became stronger as its arm became
weaker.&nbsp; The degradation of slavery and the heavy hand of
the tax-gatherer were extending even to Wales.&nbsp; The
barbarian invader found the effeminate, luxurious empire an easy
prey.&nbsp; In 410 Alaric and his host of Goths appeared before
the city of Rome itself; and a horde of barbarians, thirsting for
blood and spoil, surged into it.&nbsp; The fall of the great city
was a shock to the whole world; the end of the world must be
near, for how could it stand without Rome?&nbsp; Jerome could
hardly sob the strange news: &ldquo;Rome, which enslaved the
whole world, has itself been taken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rome had taken the yoke of Christ; and many said that it fell
because it had spurned the gods that had given it victory.&nbsp;
Three years after Alaric had sacked it, Augustine wrote a book to
prove that it was not the city of God that had fallen; and that
the heathen gods could neither have built Rome in their love nor
destroyed it in their anger.&nbsp; He then describes the rise of
the real &ldquo;City <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>of God,&rdquo; in the midst of which
is the God of justice and mercy, and &ldquo;she shall not be
moved.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>IV<br />
THE NAME OF CHRIST</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> name of Christ had been heard
in Britain during the period of Roman rule, but we do not know
who first sounded it.&nbsp; There are many beautiful
legends&mdash;that the great apostle of the Gentiles himself came
to Britain; that Joseph of Arimathea, having been placed by the
Jews in an open boat, at the mercy of wind and wave, landed in
Britain; that some of the captives taken to Rome with Caratacus
brought back the tidings of great joy.</p>
<p>We know that the name of Christ, between 200 and 300 years
after His death, was well known in Britain, and that churches had
been built for His worship.&nbsp; Between 300 and 400 we have an
organised church and a settled creed.&nbsp; Between 400 and 500
there was searching of heart and creed, and heresies&mdash;a sure
sign that the people were alive to religion.&nbsp; Between <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>500 and 600
there was a translation of the Bible from Hebrew and Greek into
the better-known Latin.&nbsp; The whole of Wales becomes
Christian; and probably St David converted the last pagans, and
built his church among them.</p>
<p>Between 450 and 500 a stream of pagan Teutons flowed over the
east of Britain, and the British Church was separated from the
Roman Church.&nbsp; By 664 British and Roman missionaries had
converted the English; and the two Churches of Rome and Britain,
once united, were face to face again.&nbsp; But they had grown in
different ways, and refused to know each other.&nbsp; Their
Easter came on different days; they did not baptize in the same
way; the tonsure was different&mdash;a crescent on the forehead
of the British monk, and a crown on the pate of the Roman
monk.&nbsp; In the Roman Church there was rigid unity and system;
in the British Church there was much room for
self-government.&nbsp; The newly converted English chose the
Roman way, because they were told that St Peter, whose see Rome
was, held the keys of heaven.&nbsp; Between 700 and 800 the Welsh
gradually gave up their religious independence, and joined the
Roman Church.</p>
<p><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>But
there was another dispute.&nbsp; Were the four old Welsh
bishoprics&mdash;Bangor, St Asaph, St David&rsquo;s,
Llandaff&mdash;to be subject to the English archbishop of
Canterbury, or to have an archbishopric of their own at St
David&rsquo;s?&nbsp; By 1200 the Welsh bishoprics were subject to
the English archbishop, and Giraldus Cambrensis came too late to
save them.</p>
<p>But through all these disputes the Church was gaining
strength.&nbsp; Churches were being built everywhere.&nbsp; Up to
700 they were called after the name of their founder; between 700
and 1000 they were generally dedicated to the archangel
Michael&mdash;there are several Llanvihangels <a
name="citation1"></a><a href="#footnote1"
class="citation">[1]</a> in Wales; after 1000 new churches were
dedicated to Mary, the Mother of Christ&mdash;we have many
Llanvairs. <a name="citation2"></a><a href="#footnote2"
class="citation">[2]</a></p>
<p>Times of civil strife, or of popular indifference, came over
and over again; and the old paganism tried to reassert
itself.&nbsp; And time after time the name of Christ was sounded
again by men who thought they had seen Him.&nbsp; In the twelfth
century the Cistercian monk came to say that the world was bad,
that prayer saved the soul, <a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>and that labour was noble. <a
name="citation3"></a><a href="#footnote3"
class="citation">[3]</a>&nbsp; He was followed by the Franciscan
friar, who said that deeds of mercy and love should be added to
prayer, that Christ had been a poor man, and that men should help
each other, not only in saving souls, but in healing sickness and
relieving pain.&nbsp; In the fifteenth century the Lollard came
to say that the Church was too rich, and that it had become blind
to the truth, and Walter Brute said that men were to be justified
by faith in Christ, not by the worship of images or by the merit
of saints.&nbsp; In the sixteenth century came the Protestant,
and the sway of Rome over Wales came to an end; Bishop Morgan
translated the Bible into Welsh, and John Penry yearned for the
preaching of the Gospel in Wales.&nbsp; The Jesuit followed,
calling himself by the name of Jesus, to try to win the country
back again to Rome.&nbsp; Robert Jones toiled and schemed, and
some laid down their lives.&nbsp; The Puritan came in the
seventeenth century to demand simple worship, and Morgan Lloyd
thought that the second advent of Christ was at hand.&nbsp; <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>The
Revivalist came in the eighteenth century, and, in the name of
Christ, aroused the people of Wales to a new life of thought.</p>
<p>After all this, you will be surprised to learn that many of
the old gods still remain in Wales, and much of the old pagan
worship.&nbsp; Who drops a pin into a sacred well, or leaves a
tiny rag on a bush close by, and then wishes for something?&nbsp;
A young maiden in the twentieth century, who sacrifices to a well
heathen god.&nbsp; Until quite recently men thought that Ffynnon
Gybi, and Ffynnon Elian, and Ffynnon Ddwynwen, had in them a
power which could curse and bless, ruin and save.</p>
<p>Lud of the Silver Hand was the god of flocks and ships.&nbsp;
His caves are in Dyved still, and his was the temple on Ludgate
Hill in London.&nbsp; Merlin was a god of knowledge; he could
foretell events.&nbsp; Ceridwen was the goddess of wisdom; she
distilled wisdom-giving drops in a cauldron.&nbsp; Gwydion
created a beautiful girl from flowers, &ldquo;from red rose, and
yellow broom, and white anemony.&rdquo;&nbsp; I am not quite sure
what Coil did, but I have heard children singing the history of
&ldquo;old King Cole.&rdquo;&nbsp; Olwen also walked through
Wales in heathen times, <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>and it is said that three white
flowers rose behind her wherever she had put her foot.</p>
<h2>V<br />
THE WELSH KINGS</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> spirit of Rome remained, though
Rome itself had fallen.&nbsp; And Welsh kings rose to take the
place of the Roman ruler, trying to force the tribes of
Wales&mdash;of different races and tongues&mdash;to become one
people.</p>
<p>The chief Roman ruler, at any rate during the later wars
against the invaders, was called Dux Britanniae, &ldquo;the ruler
of Britain.&rdquo;&nbsp; It became the aim of the ablest kings to
restore the power of this officer, and to carry on his work, to
rule and defend a united country.&nbsp; And I will tell you
briefly how the kings ruled and defended Wales for more than five
hundred years&mdash;how Maelgwn tried to unite it, how Rhodri
tried to prevent the attacks of Saxon and Dane, how Howel gave it
laws, and how Griffith tried to defend it against England.</p>
<p>Between 400 and 450 Rome left Wales <a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>to look after itself.&nbsp; An able
family, called the House of Cunedda, took the power of the Dux
Britanniae, and they translated the title into
Gwledig&mdash;&ldquo;the ruler of a <i>gwlad</i>
(country).&rdquo;&nbsp; Of this family Maelgwn Gwynedd is the
most famous.&nbsp; It was his work to try to unite all the
smaller kings or chiefs of Wales under his own power as
&ldquo;the island dragon.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was a difficult thing
to persuade them; they all wanted to be independent.&nbsp; A
legend shows that Maelgwn tried guile as well as force.&nbsp; The
kings met him at Aberdovey, and they all sat in their royal
chairs on the sands.&nbsp; And Maelgwn said: &ldquo;Let him be
king over all who can sit longest on his chair as the tide comes
in.&rdquo;&nbsp; But he had made his own chair of birds&rsquo;
wings, and it floated erect when all the other chairs had been
thrown down.&nbsp; Before Maelgwn died of the yellow plague in
547, his strong arm had made Wales one united country, and had
made every corner of it Christian.</p>
<p>The new wave of nations, coming on as surely as the tide,
began to beat against Wales.&nbsp; The Picts came from the
northern parts of Britain, and Teutonic tribes swarmed across the
eastern sea.&nbsp; The Angles came to the Humber, and spread over
the plains <a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>of the north and the midlands of Roman Britain; the
Saxons came to the Thames, and won the plains and the downs of
the south-east.&nbsp; In 577 the Saxons, after the battle of
Deorham, pierced to the western sea at the mouth of the Severn;
they crept up along the valley of the Severn, burning the great
Roman towns.&nbsp; Before they reached Chester and the Dee,
however, they were defeated at the battle of Fethanlea in
584.&nbsp; But the Angles soon appeared, from the north; and
after their victory at Chester in 613, they won the plains right
to the Irish Sea.</p>
<p>Wales was now surrounded on the land side by a people who
spoke strange languages, and who worshipped different gods, for
the Angles and the Saxons were heathens.&nbsp; From the sea also
it was open to attack.&nbsp; Sometimes the Irish came.&nbsp; But
the most feared of all were the Danes, whose sudden appearance
and quick movements and desperate onslaughts were the terror of
the age.&nbsp; The &ldquo;black Danes&rdquo; came from the fords
of Norway, the &ldquo;white Danes&rdquo; from the plains of
Sweden and Denmark.&nbsp; The Danes settled on the south coast:
Tenby is a Danish name.&nbsp; Offa, the king of the Mercian
Angles, took the rich lands between the Severn and <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>the Wye; but
Offa&rsquo;s Dyke (Clawdd Offa) is probably the work of some
earlier people whose history has been lost.&nbsp; It was only by
incessant fighting that the enemy could be kept at bay.</p>
<p>Of all the kings who tried to defend his country against the
enemies which now stood round it, the greatest is Rhodri, called
Rhodri Mawr&mdash;&ldquo;the Great.&rdquo;&nbsp; From 844 to 877,
by battles on sea and land, he broke the spell of Danish and
Saxon victories; and his might and wisdom enabled him to lead his
country in those dark days.&nbsp; Like Alfred of Wessex, who
lived at the same time and faced the same task, he stemmed the
torrent of Danish invasion and beat the sea-rovers on their own
element.&nbsp; Like Alfred, he left warlike children and
grandchildren.&nbsp; One of the grandsons was Howel the Good, who
put the laws of Wales down in a book.</p>
<p>Wales and England were now, both of them in their own way,
trying to become one country.&nbsp; It was seen by many that
strength and peace were better than division and war.&nbsp; In
England, the Earls of Mercia and Wessex tried to rise into
supreme power.&nbsp; In Wales Llywelyn ab Seisyll, victorious in
many battles and wishing for peace, made the country rich and
happy.&nbsp; Still, when <a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>he died in 1022, the princes said
they would not obey another over-king.</p>
<p>But the long ships full of Danes came again; the Angles
crossed the Severn: war and misery took the place of peace and
plenty.&nbsp; Griffith, the son of Llywelyn, came to renew his
father&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; In the battle of Rhyd y Groes on the
Severn, in 1039, he drove the Mercians back; in the battle of
Pencader, in 1041, he crushed the opponents of Welsh unity; in
1044 he defeated the sea-rovers at Aber Towy.&nbsp; At the same
time Harold, Earl of Wessex, was making himself king of
England.&nbsp; A war broke out between Griffith and Harold; and,
during it, in 1063, the great Welsh king&mdash;&ldquo;the head
and the shield of the Britons&rdquo;&mdash;was slain by
traitors.</p>
<p>So far I have told you about a few, only the greatest, kings
of the House of Cunedda.&nbsp; I know that you are wondering
where Arthur comes in.&nbsp; I am not quite sure that Arthur ever
really lived, except in the mind of many ages.&nbsp; He is the
spirit of Roman rule, the true Dux Britanniae, and he has all the
greatness and ability of all the race of Cunedda.&nbsp; I have
been shown mountains under which he sleeps, with his knights
around him, waiting for the time when his <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>country is to
be delivered.&nbsp; Let us hope that what Arthur
represents&mdash;courage and wisdom, love of country and love of
right&mdash;lives in the hearts of his people.</p>
<h2>VI<br />
THE LAWS OF HOWEL</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> two ideas which ruled Wales
were&mdash;the love of order and the love of independence.&nbsp;
The danger of the first is oppression; the dangers of the other
are anarchy and weakness.&nbsp; Wales was sometimes united, under
a Maelgwn or a Rhodri, and the princes obeyed them; oftener,
perhaps, the princes of the various parts ruled in their own
way.</p>
<p>The internal life of Wales is best seen in the laws of Howel
the Good.&nbsp; Howel was the grandson of Rhodri; and, about 950,
he called four men from each district to Hendy Gwyn (Whitland) to
state the laws of the country.&nbsp; Twelve of the wisest put the
law together; and the most learned scribe in Wales wrote it.</p>
<p><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>It was
thought that there should be one king over the whole people, but
it was very rarely that every part of Wales obeyed one
king.&nbsp; The country was divided into smaller kingdoms.&nbsp;
In many ways Gwynedd was the most powerful.&nbsp; It was very
easy to defend; for it was made up of the island of M&ocirc;n
(Anglesey), the promontory of Lleyn, and the mountain mass of
Snowdon.&nbsp; Its steep side was thus towards England, and its
cornlands and pastures on the further side.&nbsp; It was also the
home of the family of Cunedda, from Maelgwn to the last
Llywelyn.</p>
<p>Powys was the Berwyn country.&nbsp; Ceredigion was the western
slope of the Plinlimmon range; the eastern slopes had many
smaller, but very warlike, districts.&nbsp; Deheubarth contained
the pleasant glades and great forests of the Towy country.&nbsp;
Dyved was the peninsula to the west; the southern slopes of the
Beacons were Morgannwg and Gwent.</p>
<p>Howel the Good found that the laws of the various parts
differed in details, and he gave different versions to the north,
the south-west, and the south-east.&nbsp; But the law and life of
the whole people, if we only look at important features, are
one.&nbsp; <a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>Several commotes made a cantrev, many cantrevs made a
kingdom, many kingdoms made Wales.</p>
<p>In each commote there were two kinds of people&mdash;the free
or high-born, and the low-born or serfs.&nbsp; These may have
been the conquering Celt and the conquered Iberian.&nbsp; It was
very difficult for those in the lower class to rise to the
higher; but, after passing through the storms of a thousand
years, the old dark line of separation was quite lost sight
of.</p>
<p>The free family lived in a great house&mdash;in the
<i>hendre</i> (&ldquo;old homestead&rdquo;) in winter, and in the
mountain <i>havoty</i> (&ldquo;summer house&rdquo;) in
summer.&nbsp; The sides of the house were made of giant forest
trees, their boughs meeting at the top and supporting the roof
tree.&nbsp; The fire burnt in the middle of the hall.&nbsp; Round
the walls the family beds were arranged.&nbsp; The family was
governed by the head of the household (<i>penteulu</i>), whose
word was law.</p>
<p>The highest family in the land was that of the king.&nbsp; In
his hall all took their own places, his chief of the household,
his priest, his steward, his falconer, his judge, his bard, his
chief huntsman, his mediciner, and others.&nbsp; The chief royal
residences were Aberffraw <a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>in M&ocirc;n, Mathraval in Powys, and
Dynevor in Deheubarth.</p>
<p>Old Welsh law was very unlike the law we obey now.&nbsp; I
cannot tell you much about it in a short book like this, but it
is worth noticing that it was very humane.&nbsp; We do not get in
it the savage and vindictive punishments we get in some
laws.&nbsp; I give you some extracts from the old laws of the
Welsh.</p>
<p>The king was to be honoured.&nbsp; According to the laws of
Gwynedd, if any one did violence in his presence he had to pay a
great fine&mdash;a hundred cows, and a white bull with red ears,
for every cantrev the king ruled; a rod of gold as long as the
king himself, and as thick as his little finger; and a plate of
gold, as broad as the king&rsquo;s face, and as thick as a
ploughman&rsquo;s nail.</p>
<p>The judge, whether of the king&rsquo;s court or of the courts
of his subjects, was to be learned, just, and wise.&nbsp; Thus,
according to the laws of Dyved, was an inexperienced judge to be
prepared for his great office; he was to remain in the court in
the king&rsquo;s company, to listen to the pleas of judges who
came from the country, to learn the laws and customs that were in
force, especially the three main divisions of law, and the value
<a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>of all
tame animals, and of all wild beasts and birds that were of use
to men.&nbsp; He was to listen especially to the difficult cases
that were brought to the court, to be solved by the wisdom of the
king.&nbsp; When he had lived thus for a year, he was to be
brought to the church by the chaplain; and there, over the relics
and before the altar, he swore, in the presence of the great
officers of the king&rsquo;s court, that he would never knowingly
do injustice, for money or love or hate.&nbsp; He is then brought
to the king, and the officers tell the king that he has taken the
solemn oath.&nbsp; Then the king accepts him as a judge, and
gives him his place.&nbsp; When he leaves, the king gives him a
golden chessboard, and the queen gold rings, and these he is
never to part with.</p>
<p>I will tell you about one other officer&mdash;the
falconer.&nbsp; Falconry was the favourite pastime of the kings
and nobles of the time; indeed, everybody found it very exciting
to watch the long struggle in the air between the trained falcon
and its prey, as each bird tried every skill of wing and talon
that it knew.&nbsp; The falconer was to drink very sparingly <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>in the
king&rsquo;s hall, for fear the falcons might suffer; and his
lodging was to be in the king&rsquo;s barn, not in the
king&rsquo;s hall, lest the smoke from the great fire-place
should dim the falcon&rsquo;s sight.</p>
<h2>VII<br />
THE NORMANS</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the death of Griffith ap
Llywelyn, many princes tried to become supreme.&nbsp; Bleddyn of
Powys, a good and merciful prince, became the most important.</p>
<p>In January 1070, when the snow lay thick on the mountains,
William, the Norman Conqueror, appeared at Chester with an
army.&nbsp; He had defeated and killed Harold, the conqueror of
Griffith ap Llywelyn, in 1066; he had crushed the power of the
Mercian allies of Bleddyn; he had struck terror into the wild
north, and England lay at his feet.</p>
<p>He turned back from Chester, but he placed on the borders a
number of barons who were to conquer Wales, as he had conquered
England.&nbsp; They had a measure of his ability, of his energy,
and of his ambition.</p>
<p>The two great Norman traits were wisdom <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>and courage;
but the one was often mere cunning, and the other brutal
ferocity.&nbsp; But no one like the Norman had yet appeared in
Wales&mdash;no one with a vision so clear, or with so hard a
grip.&nbsp; A hard, worldly, tenacious, calculating race they
were; and they turned their faces resolutely towards Wales.</p>
<p>From England, Wales can be entered and attacked along three
valleys&mdash;along the Dee, the Severn, and the Wye.&nbsp; At
Chester, Hugh of Avranches, called &ldquo;The Wolf,&rdquo; placed
himself.&nbsp; From its walls he could look over and covet the
Welsh hills, as he could have looked over the Breton hills from
Avranches.&nbsp; He loved war and the chase: he despised
industry, he cared not for religion; he was a man of strong
passions, but he was generous, and he respected worth of
character.&nbsp; One of his followers, Robert, had all his vices
and few of his virtues.&nbsp; It was he who extended the
dominions of the Earl of Chester along the north coast to the
Clwyd, where he built a castle at Rhuddlan; and thence on to the
valley of the Conway, where he built a castle at Deganwy.&nbsp;
The cruelty of Robert shocked even the Normans of his time.&nbsp;
He even set foot in Anglesey, which looked temptingly <a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>near from
Deganwy, and built a castle at Aberlleiniog.</p>
<p>At Shrewsbury, where the Severn, after leaving the mountains
of Wales, turns to the south, Roger of Montgomery was placed,
with his wife Mabel, an energetic little woman, hated and feared
by all.&nbsp; Roger himself, while ever ready to fight, preferred
to get what he wanted by persuasion; he was not less cruel than
Hugh of Chester, but he was less fond of war.&nbsp; He and his
sons pushed their way up the Severn, and built a castle at
Montgomery.</p>
<p>To Hereford, on the Wye, William Fitz-Osbern came.&nbsp; He
was the ablest, perhaps, of all the followers of the
Conqueror.&nbsp; He entered Wales; he saw it from the Wye to the
sea, and he thought it was not large enough, and that it was too
far from the political life of the time.&nbsp; So he went back to
Normandy, but he left his sons William and Roger behind
him.&nbsp; William had his father&rsquo;s wisdom.&nbsp; Roger had
his father&rsquo;s recklessness in action; he rebelled against
his own king, and found himself in prison.&nbsp; The king sent
him, on the day of Christ&rsquo;s Passion, a robe of silk and
rarest ermine.&nbsp; The caged baron made <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>a roaring
fire, and cast the robe into it.&nbsp; &ldquo;By the light of
God,&rdquo; said William the Conqueror, for that was his wicked
oath, &ldquo;he shall never leave his prison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But another Norman, Bernard of Neufmarch&eacute;, came to take
his place.&nbsp; He built his castle at Brecon, and defeated and
killed Rees, the King of Deheubarth; and, with great energy, he
took possession of the upper valleys of the Wye and the Usk.</p>
<p>Further south William the Conqueror himself came to Cardiff,
and possibly built a castle.&nbsp; The Norman conquest of the
south coast of Wales was exceedingly rapid, and castle after
castle rose to mark the new victorious advances&mdash;Coety,
Cenfig, Neath, Kidwelly, Pembroke, Newport, Cilgeran.</p>
<p>So far, the Norman advance has been a most quick one.&nbsp; In
less than twenty-five years from the appearance of the Conqueror
at Chester, the whole country had been overrun except the
mountains of Gwynedd and the forests of the Deheubarth.&nbsp;
This success is easily explained.</p>
<p>For one thing, the Normans had trained, professional soldiers,
who were well horsed and well armed.&nbsp; In a pitched battle
the <a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>hastily collected Welsh levies, unused to regular battle
and very lightly armed, had no chance.</p>
<p>Again, the Norman never receded.&nbsp; He was willing to stop
occasionally, in order to bide his time; but he clung tenaciously
to every mile he had won.&nbsp; His skill as a castle builder was
as striking as his prowess in battle or his cautious wisdom in
council.&nbsp; He took possession of an old fortified post, or
hastily constructed one of turf and timber; but he soon turned it
into a castle of stone.&nbsp; At that time the Welsh had no
knowledge of sieges; and their impetuous valour was of no use
against the new castles.</p>
<p>Again, the Welsh opposition was not only not organised, but
weakened by internal strife.&nbsp; While the Norman was winning
valley after valley, the Welsh princes were trying to decide by
the issue of battle who was to be chief.&nbsp; Bleddyn was slain
in 1075; and his nephews and cousins tried to rule the
country.&nbsp; Among these, Trahaiarn was a soldier of ability
and energy, and a ruler of real genius.&nbsp; But he was the
rival of the exiled princes of the House of Cunedda, and he found
it difficult to bend Snowdon and the Vale of Towy to his
will.&nbsp; Two of the exiles met him, probably near some <a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>of the cairns
in the valley of the Teivy; and there, in the battle of Mynydd
Carn, fiercely fought through the dusk into a moonlight night in
1079, Trahaiarn fell.&nbsp; It looked as if no leader could rise
in Wales to fight a Norman army or to take a Norman castle.</p>
<h2>VIII<br />
GRIFFITH AP CONAN AND GRIFFITH AP REES</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the battle of Mynydd Carn, a
young chief led the shining shields of the men of Gwynedd.&nbsp;
He was Griffith, the son of a prince of the line of Cunedda and
of a sea-rover&rsquo;s daughter.&nbsp; He was mighty of limb,
fair and straight to see, with the blue eyes and flaxen hair of
the ruling Celt.&nbsp; In battle, he was full of fury and
passion; in peace, he was just and wise.&nbsp; His people saw at
first that he could fight a battle; then they found he could rule
a country.&nbsp; And it was he that was to say to the Norman:
&ldquo;Thus far shalt thou come, and no further.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Bleddyn died in 1075, Griffith came <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>to Gwynedd,
and found that his father&rsquo;s lands were under new
rulers.&nbsp; Robert of Rhuddlan and Trahaiarn of Arwystli were
mighty foes; but Griffith drove both of them back; and, by his
prowess and success in battle, broke the spell of conquest which
kept Gwynedd in bonds.&nbsp; But his enemies attacked him again
from all sides; and, while Hugh the Wolf and Robert of Rhuddlan
were laying Gwynedd waste, Trahaiarn and Griffith met at the
hard-fought battle of Bron yr Erw.&nbsp; Griffith lost the day,
and again became a sea-rover.&nbsp; He sailed to Dyved, and there
he met Rees, the King of Deheubarth, who also was of the line of
Cunedda, and had been driven from his land by the Normans.&nbsp;
The two chiefs joined, and they crushed Trahaiarn at Mynydd
Carn.&nbsp; Then they turned against the Normans.</p>
<p>Rees soon fell in battle, and left two children, Nest and
Griffith.&nbsp; The beauty of Nest and the genius of Rees ap
Griffith fill an important page in the history of their
country.&nbsp; Nest became the mother of the conquerors of
Ireland; Rees became the greatest of all the kings of South
Wales.</p>
<p>The Normans found that the Welsh had taken heart.&nbsp; Of
their opponents, they feared three: Griffith ap Conan, Owen of
Powys, <a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>and
Griffith ap Rees.&nbsp; The kings of England, the two sons of the
Conqueror&mdash;red, brutal William and cool, treacherous
Henry&mdash;had to come to help their barons.</p>
<p>Griffith ap Conan had a long life of strife and success.&nbsp;
In his struggle with Hugh the Wolf, he was once in The
Wolf&rsquo;s prison, and more than once he had to flee to the
sea.&nbsp; But, backed up by the liberty-loving sons of Snowdon
and by his sea-roving kinsmen, he made Gwynedd strong and
prosperous.&nbsp; He drove the Normans from Anglesey; he attacked
and killed Robert of Rhuddlan; he saw the red King of England
himself forced by storm and rain to beat a retreat from
Snowdon.&nbsp; He was loved by his people during his youth of
adventure and battle, and during his old age of safe counsel and
love of peace.&nbsp; His wife Angharad and his son Owen live with
him in the memory of his country.&nbsp; When he died, in 1137, it
was said that he had saved his people, had ruled them justly, and
had given them peace.</p>
<p>In the Severn country the princes of Powys were fighting
against the Normans also, especially against the family of
Montgomery.&nbsp; The sons of Bleddyn&mdash;Cadogan, Iorwerth,
and Meredith&mdash;were driving the invaders from the valley of
the Severn, and <a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>from Dyved, defeating their armies in battle, and
storming their castles.&nbsp; Sometimes they would make alliances
with them, and defy the King of England.&nbsp; But it is
difficult to follow each of them.&nbsp; The history of one of
them, Owen ap Cadogan, is like a romance.&nbsp; He was brave and
handsome, in love with Nest, and a very firebrand in
politics.&nbsp; The army of Henry I. was too strong for him, and
he had to submit.&nbsp; He then became the friend of the King of
England.&nbsp; It was the aim of the princes of Powys to be free,
not only from the Norman, but also from Griffith of Gwynedd and
Griffith of Deheubarth.&nbsp; They were an able and versatile
family; noble and base deeds, revolting crimes and sweet poems,
come in the stirring story of their lives.</p>
<p>What Griffith did in the north, and the sons of Bleddyn in the
east, Griffith ap Rees did in the south; he showed that the
Norman army could be beaten in battle, and that a Norman castle
could be taken by assault.&nbsp; After his father&rsquo;s death
he spent much of his youth in exile or in hiding: sometimes we
find him in Ireland, sometimes in the court of Griffith ap Conan,
sometimes with his sister Nest&mdash;now the wife of Gerald, the
custodian of Pembroke Castle.&nbsp; <a name="page39"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 39</span>But he had one aim ever before
him&mdash;to recover his father&rsquo;s kingdom and to make his
people free.&nbsp; Castle after castle rose&mdash;at Swansea,
Carmarthen, Llandovery, Cenarth, Aberystwyth&mdash;to warn him
that the hold of the Norman on the land was tightening.&nbsp; He
came to the forests of the Towy; his people rallied round him,
and his power extended from the Towy to the Teivy, and from the
Teivy to the Dovey.&nbsp; His wife, the heroic
Gwenllian&mdash;who died leading her husband&rsquo;s army against
the Normans&mdash;was Griffith ap Conan&rsquo;s daughter.&nbsp;
The great final battle between Griffith and the Normans was
fought at Cardigan in 1136, in which the great prince won a
memorable victory over the strongest army the Normans could put
in the field.&nbsp; In 1137 he died, and they said of him that he
had shown his people what they ought to do, and that he had given
them strength to do it.</p>
<p>The work of Griffith ap Conan and Griffith ap Rees was this:
they set bounds to the Norman Conquest, and saved Deheubarth and
Gwynedd from the stern rule of the alien.&nbsp; But, though the
Norman was not allowed to bring his stone castle and cruel law,
what good he brought with him was welcomed.&nbsp; The piety of
the Norman, his <a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>intellectual curiosity, and his spirit of adventure,
conquered in Welsh districts where his coat of mail and his
castle were not seen.</p>
<h2>IX<br />
OWEN GWYNEDD AND THE LORD REES</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> men who opposed the Normans
left able successors&mdash;Owen Gwynedd followed his father,
Griffith ap Conan; the Lord Rees followed his father Griffith ap
Rees; and in Powys the sons of Bleddyn were followed by the
castle builder Howel, and by the poet Owen Cyveiliog.</p>
<p>Owen Gwynedd ruled from 1137 to 1169; the Lord Rees from 1137
to 1197.&nbsp; The age was, in many respects, a great one.</p>
<p>It was, of course, an age of war.&nbsp; Up to 1154, during the
reign of Stephen, the English barons were fighting against each
other, and the king had very little power over them.&nbsp; The
most important Norman barons in Wales were the Earls of Chester
in the valley of the Dee, the Mortimers on the <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>upper Wye,
the Braoses on the upper Usk, and the Clares in the south.&nbsp;
Their castles were a continual menace to the country they had so
far failed to conquer, and the Lord Rees was glad to get
Kidwelly, and Owen Gwynedd to get Mold and Rhuddlan.</p>
<p>It was, on the whole, an age of unity.&nbsp; It was the chief
aim of Owen Gwynedd to be the ally of the Lord Rees; and in this
he succeeded, though his brother Cadwaladr, in his desire for
Ceredigion, had killed Rees&rsquo; brother, to Owen&rsquo;s
infinite sorrow.&nbsp; The princes of Powys, Madoc and Owen
Cyveiliog, were in the same alliance also, and they were helped
in their struggle with the Normans.&nbsp; Unity was never more
necessary.&nbsp; Henry II. brought great armies into Wales.&nbsp;
Once he came along the north coast to Rhuddlan.&nbsp; At another
time he tried to cross the Berwyn, but was beaten back by great
storms.&nbsp; Had he reached the upper Dee, he would have found
the united forces of the Lord Rees, Owen Cyveiliog, and Owen
Gwynedd at Corwen.&nbsp; There are many stirring episodes in
these wars: the fight at Consilt, when Henry II. nearly lost his
life; the scattering of his tents on the Berwyn by a storm that
seemed to be the fury of fiends; the reckless exposure of life <a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>in storming a
wall or in the shock of battle.&nbsp; But the Norman brought new
cruelty into war: Henry II. took out the eyes of young children
because their fathers had revolted against him; and William de
Braose invited a great number of Welsh chiefs to a feast in his
castle at Abergavenny, and there murdered them all.</p>
<p>It is a relief to turn to another feature of the age: it was
an age of great men.&nbsp; Owen Gwynedd was probably the
greatest.&nbsp; He disliked war, but he was an able general; he
made Henry II. retire without great loss of life to his own
army.&nbsp; He was a thoughtful prince, of a loving nature and
high ideals, and his court was the home of piety and
culture.&nbsp; He is more like our own ideal of a prince than any
of the other princes of the Middle Ages.&nbsp; The Lord Rees was
not less wise, and his life is less sorrowful and more
brilliant.&nbsp; He also was as great as a statesman as he was as
a general; and he made his peace with the English king in order
to make his country quiet and rich.&nbsp; Owen Cyveiliog was
placed in a more difficult position than either of his allies; he
was nearer to very ambitious Norman barons.&nbsp; He was great as
a warrior; often had his white steed been seen leading the <a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>rush of
battle.&nbsp; He was greater as a statesman: friend and foe said
that Owen was wise; and he was greater still as a poet.</p>
<p>The age was an age of poetry.&nbsp; A generation of great
Welsh poets found an equal welcome in the courts of Gwynedd,
Powys, and Deheubarth; and even the Norman barons of Morgannwg
began to feel the charm of Welsh legend and song; Robert of
Gloucester was a great patron of learning.&nbsp; One of the chief
events of the period was Lord Rees&rsquo; great Eisteddvod at
Cardigan in 1176.</p>
<p>It was an age of new ideals.&nbsp; The Crusades were preached
in Wales; the grave of Christ was held by a cruel unbeliever, and
it was the duty of a soldier to rescue it.&nbsp; It appealed to
an inborn love of war, and many Welshmen were willing to
go.&nbsp; It did good by teaching them that, in fighting, they
were not to fight for themselves.&nbsp; It was in Powys that
feuds were most bitter.&nbsp; A young warrior told a preacher,
who was trying to persuade him to take the cross: &ldquo;I will
not go until, with this lance, I shall have avenged my
lord&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;&nbsp; The lance immediately became
shivered in his hand.&nbsp; The lance once used for blind feuds
was gradually <a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>consecrated to the service of ideals&mdash;of patriotism
or of religion.</p>
<p>The age of Owen Gwynedd and the Lord Rees and Owen Cyveiliog
brought a higher ideal still.&nbsp; If the Crusader made war
sacred, the monk made labour noble.&nbsp; The chief aim of the
monk, it is true, was to save his soul.&nbsp; He thought the
world was very bad, as indeed it was; and he thought he could
best save his own soul by retiring to some remote spot, to live a
life of prayer.&nbsp; But he also lived a life of labour; he
became the best gardener, the best farmer, and the best shepherd
of the Middle Ages.&nbsp; Great monasteries were built for him,
and great tracts of land were given him, by those who were
anxious that he should pray for their souls.&nbsp; The monk who
came to Wales was the Cistercian.&nbsp; The monasteries of
Tintern, Margam, and Neath were built by Norman barons; and
Strata Florida, Valle Crucis, and Basingwerk showed that the
Welsh princes also welcomed the monks.</p>
<p>Better, then, than the brilliant wars were the poets and the
great Eisteddvod.&nbsp; Better still, perhaps, were the orchards
and the flocks of the peaceful monks.</p>
<h2><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>X<br
/>
LLYWELYN THE GREAT</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the death of the Lord Rees, one
of the grandsons of Owen Gwynedd becomes the central figure in
Welsh history.&nbsp; Llywelyn the Great rose into power in 1194,
and reigned until 1240&mdash;a long reign, and in many ways the
most important of all the reigns of the Welsh princes.</p>
<p>Llywelyn&rsquo;s first task was to become sole ruler in
Gwynedd.&nbsp; The sons of Owen Gwynedd had divided the strong
Gwynedd left them by their father, and their nobles and priests
could not decide which of the sons was to be supreme.&nbsp;
Iorwerth, the poet Howel, David, Maelgwn, Rhodri, tried to get
Gwynedd, or portions of it.&nbsp; Eventually, David I. became
king; but soon a strong opposition placed Llywelyn, the able son
of Iorwerth, on the throne.&nbsp; Uncles and cousins showed some
jealousy; but the growing power of Llywelyn soon made them obey
him with gradually diminishing envy.</p>
<p>His next task was to attach the other princes of Wales to him,
now that the Lord <a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>Rees and Owen Cyveiliog were dead.&nbsp; To begin with,
he had to deal with the astute Gwenwynwyn, the son of Owen
Cyveiliog; and he had to be forced to submit.&nbsp; He then
turned to the many sons and grandsons of the Lord
Rees&mdash;Maelgwn and Rees the Hoarse especially.&nbsp; They
called John, King of England, into Wales; but they soon found
that Llywelyn was a better master than John and his barons.&nbsp;
Gradually Llywelyn established a council of chiefs&mdash;partly a
board of conciliation, and partly an executive body.&nbsp; It was
nothing new; but it was a striking picture of the way in which
Llywelyn meant to join the princes into one organised political
body.</p>
<p>His third task was to begin to unite Norman barons and Welsh
chiefs under his own rule.&nbsp; He had to begin in the old way,
by using force; and Ranulph of Chester and the Clares trembled
for the safety of their castles.&nbsp; He then offered political
alliance; and some of the Norman families of the greatest
importance in the reign of John&mdash;the Earl of Chester, the
family of Braose, and the Marshalls of Pembroke&mdash;became his
allies.&nbsp; His other step was to unite Welsh and Norman
families by marriage.&nbsp; He himself married a daughter <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>of King John,
and he gave his own daughters in marriage to a Braose and a
Mortimer.&nbsp; It is through the dark-haired Gladys, who married
Ralph Mortimer, that the kings of England can trace their descent
from the House of Cunedda.</p>
<p>Llywelyn&rsquo;s last great task was to make relations between
England and Wales relations of peace and amity.&nbsp; During his
long reign, he saw three kings on the throne of England&mdash;the
crusader Richard, the able John, and the worthless and mean Henry
III.&nbsp; It was with John that he had most to do, the king
whose originality and vices have puzzled and shocked so many
historians.&nbsp; John helped him to crush Gwenwynwyn, then
helped the jealous Welsh princes to check the growth of his
power.&nbsp; Llywelyn saw that it was his policy, as long as John
was alive, to join the English barons.&nbsp; They were then
trying to force Magna Carta upon the King, that great document
which prevented John from interfering with the privileges of his
barons.&nbsp; In that document John promises, in three clauses,
that he will observe the rights of Welshmen and the law of
Wales.</p>
<p>When John died in 1216, and his young son Henry succeeded him,
the policy of <a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>England was guided by William Marshall Earl of
Pembroke.&nbsp; William Marshall was one of the ministers of
Henry II., and by his marriage with the daughter of Strongbow,
the conqueror of Ireland, he had become Earl of Pembroke.&nbsp;
It was with him that Llywelyn had now to deal.&nbsp; He was too
strong in Pembroke to be attacked, but his very presence made it
easier for Llywelyn to retain the allegiance of the chiefs who
would have been in danger from the Norman barons if
Llywelyn&rsquo;s protection were taken away.&nbsp; In 1219 the
great William Marshall died; and changes in English politics
forced his sons into an alliance with Llywelyn.</p>
<p>Llywelyn&rsquo;s title of Great is given him by his Norman and
English contemporaries.&nbsp; He was great as a general; his
detection of trouble before the storm broke, his instant
determination and rapidity of movements, his ever-ready munitions
for battle and siege, made his later campaigns always
successful.&nbsp; He felt that he was carrying on war in his own
country; so his wars were not wars of devastation, but the
crushing of armies and the razing of castles.</p>
<p>He took an interest in the three great agents in the
civilisation of the time&mdash;the <a name="page49"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>bard, the monk, and the friar.&nbsp;
The bard was as welcome as ever at his court; the monk, welcomed
by Owen Gwynedd before, was given another home at Aber
Conway.&nbsp; Llywelyn extended his welcome to the friar, and he
was given a home at Llan Vaes in Anglesey, on the shores of the
Menai.&nbsp; The friar brought a higher ideal than that of the
monk; his aim was salvation, not by prayer in the solitude of a
mountain glen, but by service where men were thickest
together&mdash;even in streets made foul by vice, and haunted by
leprosy.&nbsp; Of the Mendicant Orders, the Franciscans were the
best known in Wales; and, of all Orders of that day, it was they
who sympathised most deeply with the sorrows of men.&nbsp; And it
was this which, a little later on, brought them so much into
politics.</p>
<p>Great and successful in war and policy, in touch with the
noblest influences in the life of the time, Llywelyn applied
himself to one last task.&nbsp; His companions and allies had
nearly all died before him; but he wished that the peace and
unity, which they had established, should live after them.&nbsp;
He had two sons&mdash;Griffith, who was the champion of
independence; and David, who wished for peace with England.&nbsp;
Llywelyn laid <a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>more stress on strong government at home than on the
repudiation of feudal allegiance to the King of England.&nbsp; So
he persuaded the council of princes at Strata Florida to accept
David as his successor.</p>
<h2>XI<br />
THE LAST LLYWELYN</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">David</span> II., a mild and well-meaning
prince, was too weak to carry his father&rsquo;s policy
out.&nbsp; He tried to maintain peace, and did homage to his
uncle, the King of England.&nbsp; But, as the head of the
patriotic party, his more energetic brother, Griffith, opposed
him.&nbsp; By guile he caught Griffith, and shut him in a castle
on the rock of Criccieth.&nbsp; The other princes shook off the
yoke of Gwynedd, and Henry III. tried to play the brothers
against each other.&nbsp; David sent Griffith to Henry, who put
him in the Tower of London.&nbsp; In trying to escape, his rope
broke, and he fell to the ground dead.&nbsp; Soon afterwards, in
1246, in the middle of a war with Henry, David died of a broken
heart.</p>
<p><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>The
sons of Griffith&mdash;Owen, Llywelyn, and David&mdash;at once
took their uncle&rsquo;s place; and by 1255 Llywelyn ap Griffith
was sole ruler.&nbsp; By that year Henry III. had given his young
son Edward the earldom of Chester, which had fallen to the crown,
and the lands between the Dee and the Conway, which he claimed by
a treaty with the dead Griffith.&nbsp; Thus Edward and Llywelyn
began their long struggle.</p>
<p>Between 1255 and 1267 Llywelyn tries to recover his
grandfather&rsquo;s position in Wales.&nbsp; In 1255 his power
extended over Gwynedd only.&nbsp; He found it easy to extend it
over most of Wales, because the rule of the English officials
made the Welsh chiefs long for the protection of Gwynedd.&nbsp;
The Barons&rsquo; War paralysed the power of the King, and
Llywelyn made an alliance with Simon de Montfort and the
barons.&nbsp; Even after Montfort&rsquo;s fall in 1265 the barons
were so powerful that the King was still at their mercy.&nbsp; In
1267 Llywelyn&rsquo;s position as Prince of Wales was recognised
in the Treaty of Montgomery.&nbsp; His sway extended from Snowdon
to the Dee on the east, and to the Teivy and the Beacons on the
south&mdash;practically the whole of modern Wales, except the
southern seaboard.&nbsp; Within these wide bounds all the <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>Welsh barons
were to swear fealty to Llywelyn, the only exception being
Meredith ap Rees of Deheubarth.</p>
<p>The second struggle of Llywelyn&rsquo;s reign took place
between 1267 and 1277.&nbsp; He tried to weld his land into a
closer union, and many of the chiefs of the south and east became
willing to call in the English King.&nbsp; Two of them, his own
brother David and Griffith of Powys, fled to England, and were
received by Edward, who had been king since 1272.&nbsp; Llywelyn
and Edward distrusted each other.&nbsp; Edward wished to unite
Britain in a feudal unity, and to crush all opponents.&nbsp;
Llywelyn thought of helping the barons; he might become their
leader.&nbsp; Eleanor, the daughter of Simon de Montfort, the old
leader of the barons, was betrothed to him.&nbsp; War broke
out.&nbsp; The barons&mdash;Clares and Mortimers, and
all&mdash;joined the King.&nbsp; Llywelyn&rsquo;s dominions were
invaded at all points, his barons had to yield, one after the
other; and finally, in 1277, Llywelyn had to accept the Treaty of
Rhuddlan.&nbsp; His dominions shrunk to the old limits of
Snowdon, his sway over the rest of Wales was taken from him, and
the title of Prince of Wales was to cease with his life.</p>
<p><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>The
third struggle was between 1277 and 1282.&nbsp; The rule of the
new officials drove the Welsh to revolt; and the chiefs who had
opposed Llywelyn, especially his brother David, begged for
Llywelyn&rsquo;s protection.&nbsp; Eleanor, Llywelyn&rsquo;s wife
and Edward&rsquo;s cousin, tried to keep the peace, but she died
while they were arming for the last bitter war of 1282.</p>
<p>It was comparatively easy for Edward to overrun Powys or
Deheubarth, if he had an army strong enough.&nbsp; But at that
time Gwynedd was almost impregnable.&nbsp; From Conway to Harlech
lies the vast mass of Snowdon, a great natural rampart running
from sea to sea.&nbsp; Its steep side is towards the east, and
the invader found before him heights which he could not climb,
and round which he could not pass.&nbsp; If you stand in the Vale
of Conway, look at the hills on the Arvon side&mdash;the great
natural wall of inmost Gwynedd, with its last tower, the Penmaen
Mawr, rising right from the sea.&nbsp; The gentle slopes are to
the west, and there the corn and flocks were safe.</p>
<p>Edward had to put a large army into the field, and it cost him
much.&nbsp; In the war with Llywelyn he had to change the English
army entirely; and, in order to get <a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>money, he had to allow the Parliament
to get life and power.&nbsp; To carry supplies, and to land men
in Anglesey to turn the flank of the Welsh, he wanted a
fleet.&nbsp; But there was no royal navy then, and the fishermen
of the east coast and the south coast&mdash;who had no quarrel
with the Welsh, but were very anxious to fight each
other&mdash;were not willing to lose their fish harvest in order
to fight so far away.</p>
<p>In 1282, Edward&rsquo;s great army closed round Snowdon.&nbsp;
The chiefs still faithful to Llywelyn had to yield or flee.&nbsp;
But winter was coming on, and could Edward keep his army in the
field?&nbsp; An attempt had been made to enter Snowdon from
Anglesey, but the English force was destroyed at Moel y
Don.&nbsp; It looked as if Edward would have to retire.&nbsp;
Llywelyn left Snowdon, and went to Ceredigion and the Vale of
Towy to put new heart in his allies, and from there he passed on
to the valley of the Wye.&nbsp; He meant, without a doubt, to get
the barons of the border, Welsh and English, to unite against
Edward.&nbsp; But in some chance skirmish a soldier slew him, not
knowing who he was.&nbsp; When they heard that their Prince was
fallen, his men in Snowdon entirely lost heart.&nbsp; They had <a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>no faith in
David, and in a few months the whole of Wales was at
Edward&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<h2>XII<br />
CONQUERED WALES</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> war between Edward and Llywelyn
was not a war between England and Wales, as we think of these
countries now.&nbsp; Some of the best soldiers under Edward were
Welsh, especially the bowmen who followed the Earl of Gloucester
and Roger Mortimer from the Wye and Severn valleys.</p>
<p>It is not right that we Welshmen should feel bitter against
England, because, in this last war, Edward won and Llywelyn
fell.&nbsp; It is easy to say that Edward was cruel and
faithless, and it is easy to say that Llywelyn was shifty and
obstinate; but it is quite clear that each of them thought that
he was right.&nbsp; Edward thought that Britain ought to be
united: Llywelyn thought Wales ought to be free.&nbsp; Now,
happily, we have the union and the freedom.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I should not like you to think that Wales
was more barbarous <a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>than England, or Llywelyn less civilised than Edward
I.&nbsp; Giraldus Cambrensis saw a prince going barefoot, and the
fussy little Archbishop Peckham saw that Welsh marriage customs
were not what he liked; and many historians, who have never read
a line of Welsh poetry, take for granted that the conquest of
Wales was a new victory for civilisation.</p>
<p>In many ways Wales was more civilised than England at that
time.&nbsp; Its law was more simple and less developed, it is
true; but it was more just in many cases, and certainly more
humane.&nbsp; Was it not better that the land should belong to
the people, and that the youngest son should have the same chance
as the eldest?&nbsp; And, in crime, was it not better that if no
opportunity for atonement was given, the death of the criminal
was to be a merciful one?&nbsp; In the reign of John, a Welsh
hostage, a little boy of seven, was hanged at Shrewsbury, because
his father, a South Wales chief, had rebelled.&nbsp; In the reign
of Edward I., the miserable David was dragged at the tails of
horses through the streets of the same town, and the tortures
inflicted on the dying man were too horrible to describe to
modern ears.&nbsp; And what the Norman baron <a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>did, his
Welsh tenant learnt to do.&nbsp; In Wales you get fierce frays
and frequent shedding of blood; on the borders you get callous
cruelty to a prisoner, or the disfiguring of dead
bodies&mdash;even that of Simon de Montfort, the greatest
statesman of the Middle Ages in England&mdash;on the battlefield
when all passion was spent.</p>
<p>Take the rulers of Wales again.&nbsp; Griffith ap Conan and
Llywelyn the Great had the energy and the foresight, though their
sphere was so much smaller, of Henry II.&nbsp; And what English
king, except Alfred, attracts one on account of lovableness of
character as Owen Gwynedd and Owen Cyveiliog and the Lord Rees
do?</p>
<p>When Edward entered into Snowdon, Welsh was spoken to the Dee
and the Severn, and far beyond.&nbsp; There were many dialects,
as there are still, though any two Welshmen could understand each
other wherever they came from, with a little patience, as they
can still.&nbsp; But there was also a literary language, and this
was understood, if not spoken, by the chiefs all through the
country.&nbsp; It was more like the Welsh spoken in
mid-Wales&mdash;especially in the valley of the Dovey&mdash;than
any other.&nbsp; There are many signs of civilisation; one of
them is <a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>the possession of a literary language&mdash;for romance
and poem, for court and Eisteddvod.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Conquered Wales may be divided into two parts&mdash;the Wales
conquered by the Norman barons and the Wales conquered by the
English king.</p>
<p>The Wales conquered by the English king was the country ruled
by Llywelyn and his allies.&nbsp; In 1284, by the statute of
Rhuddlan, it was formed into six shires.&nbsp; The Snowdon
district&mdash;which held out last&mdash;was made into the three
shires of Anglesey, Carnarvon, and Merioneth.&nbsp; The part of
the land between Conway and Dee that belonged to the king, not to
barons, was made into the shire of Flint.&nbsp; The lands of
Llywelyn&rsquo;s allies beyond the Dovey were made into the
shires of Cardigan and Carmarthen.&nbsp; Instead of the chiefs of
the Welsh prince, the king&rsquo;s sheriffs and justices ruled
the country.&nbsp; But much of the old law remained.</p>
<p>The Wales conquered by the Norman barons lay to the east and
south of the Wales turned into shires in 1284.&nbsp; It included
the greater part of the valleys of the Clwyd, Dee, Severn, and
Wye; and the South Wales coast from Gloucester to <a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>Pembroke.&nbsp; It remained in the possession of lords
who were subject to the King of England, but who ruled almost
like kings in their own lordships.&nbsp; The laws and customs of
the various lordships differed greatly; sometimes the lord used
English law, and sometimes Welsh law.&nbsp; The great ruling
families changed much in wealth and power, from century to
century.&nbsp; In Llywelyn&rsquo;s time the most important were
the Clares (Gloucester and Glamorgan), the Mortimers (Wigmore and
Chirk), Lacy (Denbigh), Warenne (Bromfield and Yale), Fitzalan
(Oswestry), Bohun (Brecon), Braose (Gower), and Valence
(Pembroke).</p>
<p>Llywelyn was the last prince of independent Wales.&nbsp; From
that time on, the title is conferred by the King of England on
his eldest son, who is then crowned.&nbsp; The present Prince of
Wales also comes, through a daughter of Llywelyn the Great, from
the House of Cunedda, the princes of which ruled Wales from Roman
times to 1284.&nbsp; Of all the houses that have gone to make the
royal house, this is the most ancient.</p>

CASTLE AND LONG-BOW</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">So</span> far I have told you very little
about war, except that a battle was fought and lost, or a castle
built or taken.</p>
<p>War has two sides&mdash;attack and defence.&nbsp; New ways of
attacking and defending are continually devised.&nbsp; When the
art of defence is more perfect than the art of attack, the world
changes very little, for the strong can keep what he has
gained.&nbsp; When the art of attack is the more perfect, new men
have a better chance, and many changes are made.&nbsp; The chief
source of defence was the castle, the chief weapon of attack was
the long-bow.&nbsp; Wales contains the most perfect castles in
this country; it is also the home of the long-bow.&nbsp; From
1066 to 1284 England and Wales were conquered, and the conquest
was permanent because castles were built.&nbsp; From 1284 to
1461, England and Wales attacked other countries, and the weapon
which gave them so many victories was the long-bow.</p>
<p>I will tell you about the castles first, about <a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>the Norman
castles and about the Edwardian castles.</p>
<p>The Norman castle was a square keep, with walls of immense
thickness, sometimes of 20 feet.&nbsp; But if the Norman had to
build on the top of a hill or on the ruins of an old castle, he
did not try to make the new castle square, but allowed its walls
to take the form of the hill or of the old castle; and this kind
of castle was called a shell keep.&nbsp; The outer and inner
casing of the wall would be of dressed stone, the middle part was
chiefly rubble.&nbsp; At first, if they had plenty of supplies, a
very few men could hold a castle against an army as long as they
liked.&nbsp; These were the castles built by the Norman invaders
to retain their hold over the Welsh districts they conquered.</p>
<p>But many ways of storming a castle were discovered.&nbsp; They
could be scaled by means of tall ladders, especially in a
stealthy night attack.&nbsp; Stones could be thrown over the
walls by mangonels to annoy the garrison.&nbsp; Sometimes a wall
could be brought down by a battering-ram.&nbsp; But the quickest
and surest way was by mining.&nbsp; The miners worked their way
to the wall, and then began to take some of the stones of the
outer casing out, propping the wall up with <a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>beams of
wood.&nbsp; When the hole was big enough, they filled it with
firewood; they greased the beams well, they set fire to them and
then retired to a safe distance to see what happened.&nbsp; When
the great wall crashed down, the soldiers swarmed over it to beat
down the resistance of the garrison.&nbsp; If ever you go to
Abergavenny Castle, in the Vale of Usk, look at the cleft in the
rock along which the daring besiegers once climbed.&nbsp; And if
you go to the Vale of Towy, and see Dryslwyn Castle, remember
that the wall once came down before the miners expected, and that
many men were crushed.</p>
<p>In order to prevent mining, many changes were made.&nbsp;
Moats were dug round the castle, and filled with water.&nbsp;
Brattices were made along the top of the towers, galleries
through the floor of which the defenders could pour boiling pitch
on the besiegers.&nbsp; The walls were built at such angles that
a window, with archers posted behind it, could command each
wall.&nbsp; Stronger towers were built&mdash;round towers with a
coping at each storey, solid as a rock, which would crack and
lean without falling; there is a leaning tower at Caerphilly
Castle.&nbsp; One other way I must mention&mdash;the child or the
wife of the <a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>castellan would be brought before the walls, and hanged
before his eyes unless he opened the gates.</p>
<p>The newer or Edwardian castles, those of the reigns of Henry
III. and Edward I., are concentric&mdash;that is, there are
several castles in one; so that the besiegers, when they had
taken one castle, found themselves face to face with another,
still stronger, perhaps, inside it.&nbsp; Of these castles, the
most elaborate is the castle of Caerphilly, built by Gilbert de
Clare, the Red Earl of Gloucester who helped Edward in the Welsh
wars.&nbsp; And it was by means of these magnificent concentric
castles&mdash;Conway, Beaumaris, Carnarvon, and
Harlech&mdash;that Edward hoped to keep Wales.</p>
<p>There are many kinds of bows.&nbsp; In war two were
used&mdash;the cross-bow and the long-bow.&nbsp; The cross-bow
was meant at first for the defence of towns, like Genoa or the
towns of Castile.&nbsp; So strength was more important than
lightness, and the archer had time to take aim.&nbsp; It was a
bow on a cross piece of wood, along which the string was drawn
back peg after peg by mechanism.&nbsp; The bow was then held to
the breast, and the arrow let off.&nbsp; It was clumsy, heavy,
and expensive.</p>
<p><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>The
long-bow was only one piece of sinewy yew, and a string.&nbsp; It
was used at first for the chase, and the archer had to take
instant aim.&nbsp; It was drawn to the ear, and it was a most
deadly weapon when a strong arm had been trained to draw
it.&nbsp; Its arrow could pick off a soldier at the top of the
highest castle; it could pierce through an oak door three fingers
thick; it could pin a mail-clad knight to his horse.&nbsp; It was
this peasant weapon that brought the mailed knight down in
battle.</p>
<p>The home of the long-bow is the country between the Severn and
the Wye.&nbsp; It was famous before, but it was first used with
effect in the last Welsh wars.&nbsp; It was used to break the
lines of the Snowdon lances and pikes, so that the mail-clad
cavalry might dash in.&nbsp; But later on, the same bows were
used to bring the nobles of France down.</p>
<p>From the Welsh war on, archers and infantry became important;
battles ceased to be what they had been so long&mdash;the shock
of mail-clad knights meeting each other at full charge.</p>
<p>The long-bow made noble and peasant equal on the field of
battle.&nbsp; The revolution was made complete later on by
gunpowder.</p>

/>
THE RISE OF THE PEASANT</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">have</span> told you much about princes
and soldiers, but very little about the lowly life of peasants,
and the trade of towns.</p>
<p>The conquest of Wales, by Norman baron and English king,
tended to raise the serf to the level of the freeman.&nbsp; The
chief causes of the rise of the serf were the following:</p>
<p>1&nbsp; The ignorance of the English officials.&nbsp; The
Norman baron very often paid close attention to the privileges of
the classes he ruled, and the Welsh freeman retained his
superiority.&nbsp; But the English officials&mdash;and Edward II.
found that they were far too numerous in Wales&mdash;often
refused to distinguish between a Welshman who was an innate
freeman and a Welshman who lived on a serf maenol.&nbsp; Their
aim was to make them all pay the same tax.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The fall in the value of money.&nbsp; At the time of
the Norman Conquest, silver coins were rare, and their value
high.&nbsp; But, in exchange for cloth and wool, of arrows <a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>and spears,
of mountain ponies and cattle, coins came in great numbers, and
it was easier for the serf to earn them.&nbsp; That is the value
of coins became less.</p>
<p>This was a great boon to all who were bound to pay fixed
sums&mdash;the freeman who paid to the king the dues he used to
pay to his prince, the serf who paid to his lord a sum of money
instead of service.&nbsp; All ancient servitude, political and
economic, was commuted for money; as the money became easier to
get, the serf became the more free.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; The rise of towns and the growth of commerce.&nbsp;
We must not, however, think of commerce as if it had been first
brought by the Normans.&nbsp; There had been roads and coins in
Roman times.&nbsp; The Danes had been traders, probably, before
they became pirates and invaders.&nbsp; Timber, millstones,
cattle, coarse cloth, and arrow-heads crossed the Severn
eastwards before the Normans saw it; and corn was carried
westward.&nbsp; There were close relations, political and
commercial, between Wales and Ireland from very early times.</p>
<p>But the Norman and English Conquests revived and quickened
trade.&nbsp; Towns rose, regular markets were established, and
the <a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>barons
who took tolls protected the merchants who paid them.&nbsp; Every
baron had a castle, every castle needed a walled town, and a town
cannot live except by trade.&nbsp; In the town the baron did not
ask a Welshman whether he had been free or serf; the townsmen
were strangers, and they welcomed the serf who came to work.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; The monk and the friar.&nbsp; The bard was a freeman
born, a skilled weaver of courteous phrases, not a churlish
<i>taeog</i>.&nbsp; The monk or friar might be a serf.&nbsp; They
worked like serfs, and ennobled labour.&nbsp; The Church
condemned serfdom, and we find chapters giving their serfs
freedom.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; The Scotch and French wars of the English kings gave
employment to hosts of bowmen and of men-at-arms, and to the
numerous attendants required to look after the horses by means of
which the army moved.&nbsp; The greater use of infantry after the
reign of Edward I. caused a greater demand for the peasant; and
the use of the cheap long-bow gave him a value in war.&nbsp;
There were five thousand Welsh archers and spearmen on the field
of Cressy.&nbsp; In these and other ways the serf was becoming
free.</p>
<p>You would expect a gradual, almost unconscious <a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>struggle,
between the serf and his lord for political power.&nbsp; The
struggle came, but it was conscious and very fierce.&nbsp; It was
brought about by a terrible pestilence, known as the Black
Death.&nbsp; This plague came slowly and steadily from the East;
in 1348 it reached Bristol, and it probably swept away one half
of the people of the towns of Wales.&nbsp; It was not the towns
alone that it visited; it came to the mountain glens as
well.&nbsp; It was a most deadly disease.&nbsp; It killed, for
one thing, because people believed that they would die.&nbsp;
They saw the dark spots on the skin before they became feverish;
they recognised the black mark of the Death and they gave
themselves up for lost.</p>
<p>Labourers became very scarce.&nbsp; They claimed higher
wages.&nbsp; The lords tried to drag them back into serfdom; they
tried to force them by law to take the old wage.&nbsp; On both
sides of the Severn the labourers took arms, and waged war
against their lords.&nbsp; The peasant war in England is called
the Peasant Revolt; the peasant war in Wales is sometimes called
the revolt of Owen Glendower.</p>
<p>A change came over the rebellions in Wales.&nbsp; At first,
the rebellions were those of Llywelyn&rsquo;s country; the allies
who had <a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>deserted him, and then turned against Edward, like Rees
ap Meredith; or his own followers, like Madoc, who said he was
his son; or men he had protected, like Maelgwn Vychan in
Pembroke.&nbsp; Later on, under Edward II. and Edward III., the
rebellions were against the march lords, and the king was looked
upon as a protector&mdash;such as the rebellion of Llywelyn Bren
against the Clares and Mortimers in Glamorgan in 1316.&nbsp; But
the wilder spirits went to the French wars, and fought for both
sides.&nbsp; With the assassination of Owen of Wales in 1378, the
last of Llywelyn&rsquo;s near relatives to dream of restoring the
independence of Wales, the rebellions against the King of England
came to an end.</p>
<p>When they broke out again, it was not in Snowdon or
Ceredigion; the old dominions of Llywelyn were almost unwilling
to rise.&nbsp; The new revolts were in the march lands, and
especially in the towns.</p>
<h2><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>XV<br
/>
OWEN GLENDOWER</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> English baron in Wales tried to
add to his possessions by encroaching on the lands of the Welsh
freemen.&nbsp; His estate always remained the same, because it
all went to the eldest son, according to what is called
primogeniture; their lands, on the other hand, were divided
between the sons according to what is called gavelkind.&nbsp; He
also, by laws they did not understand, took the waste
land&mdash;forest and mountain.&nbsp; As one man can more easily
watch his interest than many, the baron succeeded; but the
freemen felt that they were being robbed.</p>
<p>The tenants of the barons were restless and rebellious; they
said they were free, that they would not work as serfs, that they
would not bring food rents, but that they would pay a fixed rent
for every acre they held.</p>
<p>At Ruthin, in the Vale of Clwyd, there was a baron called Lord
Grey; and in the valley of the Dee there was a Welsh squire <a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>called Owen
Glendower.&nbsp; Their lands met, and Grey took part of
Owen&rsquo;s sheep walk.&nbsp; Owen had been a law student at
Westminster, and he had served Henry of Lancaster.&nbsp; In 1399
Richard II. had been dethroned, and the barons had made Henry of
Lancaster king as Henry IV.&nbsp; Owen saw, however, that the
king was too weak to curb his lawless barons, and in 1400 he
attacked Lord Grey, and burnt Ruthin.</p>
<p>The rebellion that had long been smouldering burst into a
flame all over the country.&nbsp; Owen was at once welcomed by
the bard, the friar, and the peasant.&nbsp; The bard hailed his
star as that of the heir of the princes, who had come to deliver
his country.&nbsp; The friar welcomed him as the friend of the
poor and of learning; and unruly students from Oxford, then the
centre of a great intellectual awakening, flocked home to march
under his banner.&nbsp; The peasant welcomed him as his protector
against the steward of his lord.&nbsp; The main strength of the
movement was the peasant revolt; and Welsh poets, like the
English ones, sang the praises of the ploughman and of the
plough.</p>
<p>Owen&rsquo;s success was most rapid, so rapid that it was put
down to magic.&nbsp; In four years the whole of Wales recognised
him as <a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>its
prince.&nbsp; Henry IV. and Prince Henry came to Wales, made
rapid marches and retook castles, punished the friars of Llan
Vaes and the monks of Strata Florida.&nbsp; But their victories
led to nothing, and the storms fought against them.&nbsp;
Owen&rsquo;s victories were used to the full&mdash;that of the
Vyrnwy was followed by an agreement with Grey of Ruthin, that of
Bryn Glas by an alliance with the Mortimers.&nbsp; His marches
were nearly all triumphant; he was welcomed along the whole line
of the marches by the peasants to the furthest corners of
Gwent.</p>
<p>Owen was wise enough to see that no abiding power can be based
on a popular rising.&nbsp; He tried to establish a government
that the King of England could not overthrow.&nbsp; He had three
institutions in mind&mdash;an independent Wales, governed by him
as Prince in a Parliament of representatives of the commotes; an
independent Welsh Church, with an Archbishop of St David&rsquo;s
at its head; and an independent system of learning and
civilisation, guided by two Universities, one in North Wales and
one in South Wales.</p>
<p>The new Wales was to be safeguarded by four
alliances&mdash;with the English barons, with the Pope, with
Scotland, and with France.&nbsp; He failed to save the Percies <a
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>from their
defeat at Shrewsbury in 1403; but he based all his plans on an
alliance with the Mortimers, the enemies of Lancaster and the
Percies.&nbsp; The head of the Mortimer family had died in
Ireland in 1398, and had left four young children.&nbsp; They
were the real heirs to the crown, and Owen meant to win their
throne for them.&nbsp; Their uncle, Edmund Mortimer, married
Glendower&rsquo;s daughter.&nbsp; But the young Earl of March,
the elder of the Mortimer boys, had no ambition, and a plot to
bring him and his brother to Owen failed.</p>
<p>The Papacy had always proved to be a broken reed for Welsh
princes; but Owen&rsquo;s alliance with Peter de Luna, the
anti-Pope Benedict XIII., gave a certain amount of prestige to
his title.&nbsp; The alliance with Scotland, based on common
kinship, could bring him no help at that time: because it was
torn between two factions during the reign of the weak Robert
III.; and the next king, the poet James I., was captured at sea
and put into an English prison.</p>
<p>The French alliance was much more promising; it would give
what Owen wanted most&mdash;siege engines, a fleet, and an army
of trained soldiers.&nbsp; Charles VI. of France, the
father-in-law of the deposed Richard, <a name="page74"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 74</span>refused to make peace with the
usurper Henry; his fleet protected the Welsh coast, and in 1405 a
French army of 2,800 men landed at Milford.</p>
<p>Owen struggled on, with waning power, until his death in
1415.&nbsp; He came too soon for success, while the power of the
House of Lancaster was increasing.</p>
<p>Of all figures in the history of Wales, that of Owen Glendower
is the most striking and the most popular.&nbsp; The place of his
grave is unknown, his lineage and the date of his death a matter
of conjecture; there is much mystery about even his most
brilliant years.&nbsp; But his majestic figure, his wisdom, and
his ideals remained in the memory of his country.&nbsp; His ghost
wandered, it was said, around Valle Crucis.&nbsp; His spirit,
more than that of any hero of the past, seems to follow his
people on their onward march.&nbsp; This is not on account of his
political ideals, but because he was the champion of the peasant
and of education.</p>

THE WARS OF THE ROSES</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> reign of Henry V. was a reign
of brilliant victories in France, and the reign of Henry VI. one
of disastrous defeats.&nbsp; During both reigns the lords were
becoming more powerful in Wales as well as in England.&nbsp; The
hold of the king over them became weaker every year; they packed
the Parliament, they appointed the Council, they overawed the law
courts.&nbsp; If a man wanted security, he must wear the badge of
some lord, and fight for him when called upon to do so.&nbsp; In
the marches of Wales there were more than a hundred lords holding
castle and court; and it was easy for a robber or a murderer to
escape from one lordship to the other, or even to find a welcome
and protection.&nbsp; In Wales and in the marches the lords
preyed upon their weaker neighbours, and the country became full
of private war.</p>
<p>The selfish families, all fighting for more land and more
power, gradually formed themselves into two parties&mdash;the
parties of the Red <a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span>Rose and of the White Rose.&nbsp; The leading family in
the Red Rose party was that of Lancaster, represented by the
saintly King Henry VI.; the leading family in the White Rose
party was that of York.&nbsp; In the Wars of the Roses, York and
Lancaster fought over the crown, and those who supported them
over a castle or an estate.</p>
<p>Wales was divided.&nbsp; The west was for Lancaster, from
Pembroke to Harlech, and from Harlech to Anglesey.&nbsp; The east
was for York, from Cardiff and Raglan to Wigmore, and from
Wigmore to Chirk.&nbsp; Lancaster held estates in Wales and on
the border&mdash;the castles of Hereford, Skenfrith, Ogmore, and
Kidwelly being centres of strength and wealth.&nbsp; York&rsquo;s
chief country was the march of Wales, with Ludlow as its
centre.&nbsp; The Welsh barons took sides according to their
interests.&nbsp; Jasper Tudor, Earl of Pembroke, held the west
for his half-brother, the king.&nbsp; Sir William Herbert, who
was very powerful in the country south of the Mortimers, took the
side of his powerful neighbour.&nbsp; Others wavered, especially
Grey of Ruthin and the Stanleys in North Wales.</p>
<p>One battle was fought between the Welsh Yorkists and the Welsh
Lancastrians.&nbsp; This <a name="page77"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 77</span>was the battle of Mortimer&rsquo;s
Cross, near Wigmore, in February 1461.&nbsp; The victor was the
young Duke of York, who was crowned king as Edward IV. later in
the year.&nbsp; An old man, Owen Tudor, the father of Jasper
Tudor, and the grandfather of the boy who was &ldquo;to rule
after them all&rdquo; as Henry VII., was taken prisoner.&nbsp;
They took him to Hereford, and there they cut his head off and
set it on the market cross.&nbsp; The battles of the Wars of the
Roses were very cruel ones; the noble prisoners that had been
taken, even children of tender age, were murdered in cold blood
on the evening of the battle.&nbsp; &ldquo;By God&rsquo;s
blood,&rdquo; said one, as he killed a child, &ldquo;thy father
slew mine, and so will I do thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Welsh barons led their men to nearly all the important
battles.&nbsp; North Wales archers, wearing the three feathers of
the Prince of Wales, fought for Lancaster in the snow at the
great defeat of Towton on the Palm Sunday of 1461; the archers of
Gwent, led by Herbert, fought vainly for York at the battle of
Edgecote, in the summer of 1469.&nbsp; And the Welsh waverer and
traitor was seen in battle also&mdash;Grey of Ruthin led the van
for Lancaster at the battle of Northampton in 1460, and caused <a
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>the battle to
be lost by deserting to York at the be ginning of the
fighting.&nbsp; In Wales itself, also, the war was fought
bitterly; and the stubborn defence of Harlech for the
Lancastrians became famous through the whole country.&nbsp; The
last battle fought between Lancaster and York was the battle of
Tewkesbury, in May 1471, and Lancaster lost it; the Prince of
Wales, the king&rsquo;s only son, was killed; and his heroic
mother, Margaret of Anjou, gave the struggle up.&nbsp; A young
Welsh noble&mdash;Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond&mdash;became the
Lancastrian heir.&nbsp; The fortunes of his house were hopeless,
however; and his uncle, Jasper, sent him in safety to
Brittany.</p>
<p>The Yorkist kings, Edward IV. and Richard III., in spite of
cruelty and murder, ruled well.&nbsp; They broke the power of the
barons, and they made the people rich&mdash;by maintaining peace,
by repressing piracy, by protecting the woollen industry of the
towns.</p>
<p>In Wales their rule was for peace and order.&nbsp; They made a
Court for Wales at Ludlow, the home of their race.&nbsp; From
Ludlow they began to force the barons to do justice and to obey
the king.&nbsp; It seemed as if the rule of the Yorkists was to
be a <a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>long
one, for they were very popular in London and the towns.</p>
<p>But the nobles were not willing to see their power taken from
them day by day.&nbsp; Jasper Tudor appealed to the loyalty of
the Welsh, and the men of West Wales wanted a king of their own
blood; for the laws had been made unjust to them ever since the
time of Owen Glendower.</p>
<p>Many attempts were made, and they failed.&nbsp; But at last,
on August 7, 1485, the fugitive Earl of Richmond came to Milford
Haven.&nbsp; He marched on to the valley of the Teivy, and he was
joined by Sir Rees ap Thomas, and an army of South Wales men; he
journeyed on through the valley of the Severn, and the North
Wales men joined him; English nobles joined him as he marched by
Shrewsbury, Stafford, Lichfield, and Tamworth.&nbsp;
Richard&rsquo;s army was also on the march.&nbsp; At Bosworth,
August 22, 1485, the two armies met in the last battle of the
Wars of the Roses.&nbsp; Richard fought fiercely, wearing his
crown; and when he was defeated and killed, the crown was placed
on Henry&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>The people of England did not care who ruled, Richard or
Henry, as long as he kept order, for they were very tired of
civil war.&nbsp; <a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>But the people of Wales welcomed Henry as a Welshman who
would rule them kindly and justly.</p>
<h2>XVII<br />
TUDOR ORDER</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Tudors&mdash;Henry VII., his
son, Henry VIII., and his three grandchildren, Edward VI. and
Mary and Elizabeth&mdash;ruled England and Wales from 1485 to
1603.&nbsp; Under them the people became united, law-abiding,
patriotic, and prosperous.&nbsp; The Tudor period is justly
regarded as the most glorious in British history, with its great
statesmen, its great adventurers, and its great poets.</p>
<p>The Tudors were loyally supported by Wales, by the military
strength of men like Sir Rees ap Thomas or the Earl of Pembroke,
and by the diplomatic skill of the Cecils.&nbsp; Under their
rule&mdash;hard and unmerciful, but just and efficient&mdash;the
law became strong enough to crush the mightiest and to shield the
weakest.&nbsp; Welshmen found that, even under their own
sovereigns, their ancient language was regarded as a hindrance <a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>and their
patriotism as a possible source of trouble; but they obtained the
privileges of an equal race, and they were pleased to regard
themselves as a dominant one.</p>
<p>They obtained equal political privileges.&nbsp; The laws which
denied them residence in the garrison towns in Wales, or the
holding of land in England, came to an end.&nbsp; The whole of
the country, shire ground and march ground, was divided into one
system of shires and given representation in Parliament, by the
Act of Union of 1535.&nbsp; It is called an Act of Union because,
by it, Wales and England were united on equal terms.</p>
<p>Anglesey, Carnarvon, Merioneth, Flint, Cardigan, and
Carmarthen had been shires since I 284; and small portions of
Glamorgan and Pembroke had been governed like shires, so that
some Tudor writers call them counties.&nbsp; The chief difference
between a shire and a lordship is that the king&rsquo;s writ runs
to the shire, but not to the lordship.&nbsp; The king administers
the law in the shire, through the sheriff; the lord administers
the law in the lordship through his own officials.</p>
<p>In 1535 the marches of Wales were turned into shire
ground.&nbsp; The bulk of them went <a name="page82"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 82</span>to make seven new
shires&mdash;Pembroke, Glamorgan, Monmouth, Brecon, Radnor,
Montgomery, and Denbigh.&nbsp; The others were added to the older
English and Welsh counties.&nbsp; Of these, those added to
Shropshire and Herefordshire and Gloucestershire became part of
England.&nbsp; Monmouth also was declared to be an English shire,
for judicial purposes; but it has remained sturdily Welsh, and
now it is practically regarded by Parliament as part of
Wales.&nbsp; The whole country was now governed in the same way,
and Wales was represented, like England, in Parliament.&nbsp; No
attempt had been made to do this before, except by the first
English Prince of Wales, the weak and unfortunate Edward II.</p>
<p>Of even greater value than political equality was the new
reign of law.&nbsp; The Tudors used the Star Chamber, the Court
of Wales, and the Great Sessions of Wales, to make all equal
before the law.&nbsp; To the Star Chamber they summoned a noble
who was still too powerful for the court of law.</p>
<p>But it was the Court of Wales that did most work.&nbsp; It was
held at Ludlow.&nbsp; It had very able presidents, men like
Bishop Lee, the Earl of Pembroke, and Sir Henry Sidney.&nbsp;
Bishop Lee struck terror into the <a name="page83"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 83</span>whole Welsh march, between 1534 and
1543.&nbsp; Before his time a lord would keep murderers and
robbers at his castle, protect them, and perhaps share their
spoil.&nbsp; But no man could keep a felon out of the reach of
Bishop Rowland Lee.&nbsp; If he could not get them alive he got
their dead bodies; and you might have seen processions of men
carrying sacks on ponies&mdash;they were dead men who were to
swing on Ludlow gibbets.&nbsp; But, severe as Lee was, the
peasant was glad that he could go to the Court at Ludlow instead
of going to the court of a march lord, as he had to do before
1535.&nbsp; The shire had been much better governed than the
lordship.&nbsp; When the lordship of Mawddwy was added to the
shire of Merioneth in 1535, the officers of the shire found that
it was a nest of brigands and outlaws.</p>
<p>In the more peaceful and humane days of Queen Elizabeth, Sir
Henry Sidney became President of the Court of Wales.&nbsp; He was
one of the best men of the day; and he was proud of ruling Wales
and the border counties, &ldquo;a third part of this
realm,&rdquo; because his high office made him able &ldquo;to do
good every day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Besides the Court of Wales for the whole country, a court of
justice was held in each <a name="page84"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 84</span>of four groups of shires; and these
courts were called the Great Sessions of Wales.&nbsp; So, though
the law was the same for everybody, Wales had a separate system
to itself, partly because there was so much to do, and partly
because the central courts in London were so far away.&nbsp; Much
was also done to get wise and learned justices of the peace, and
fair juries.</p>
<p>By the end of the reign of Elizabeth, the last of the Tudors,
one may say that Wales rejoiced in the following:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; There was no hatred between England and Wales; the
Welsh gentry served the Queen on land and sea, and the people
were more happy and contented than they had been since the time
of Llywelyn.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; There was no danger of private war between lords, to
which the peasant might be summoned.&nbsp; The brigands which
infested parts of the country had been cleared away.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; The law of land had been fixed.&nbsp; It was
determined that land was to go to the eldest son, according to
the English fashion.&nbsp; All the land became the property of
some landlord, and it was decided who was a landowner, and who
was not.&nbsp; The Welsh freemen were held to own their land; the
Welsh serfs, the descendants of an old <a name="page85"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 85</span>conquered race, sometimes became
owners and sometimes tenants.&nbsp; They all thought that Henry
VII., the Welsh victor of Bosworth, had set them free.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; The Tudors trusted their people, and called upon them
to govern and to administer justice themselves.&nbsp; The squires
were to be justices, the freemen were to be jurors; the shire was
to look after the militia, and the parish after the poor.</p>
<h2>XVIII<br />
THE REFORMATION</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Reformation in England was, to
begin with, a purely political movement.&nbsp; Henry VIII. wished
to rule his people in his own way, in religion as well as in
politics; and, eventually, he became Supreme Head of the Church
as well as the king of the country.&nbsp; His new power brought
changes.&nbsp; It was necessary to reform the Church, and the
wealth of the monasteries tempted him to do it.&nbsp; There was a
new spirit of enquiry, and the King was led on by that spirit,
with dilatory and hesitating steps, to examine <a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>old
creeds.&nbsp; The religious fervour of the Reformation had caught
the people; and the King stood still, if he did not turn
back.</p>
<p>But his ministers had no misgivings.&nbsp; Thomas Cromwell
tried to hurry the Reformation on&mdash;the monasteries were
dissolved, the Bible was translated, and the sway of Rome was
disowned.&nbsp; The king appointed the bishops, decided church
cases, and even determined what the creed of his country was to
be.&nbsp; Somerset, in the reign of Edward VI., made the movement
a doctrinal one, and forced it on with equal vigour.</p>
<p>Wales looked on, with indifference and apathy at first, and
then with murmurs.&nbsp; The movement had no attraction: it had
many causes of offence.&nbsp; In England the political movement
became a patriotic, an intellectual, and a religious movement;
and it succeeded.&nbsp; In Ireland, also, it was political, but
it could not appeal to patriotism, because it was an English
movement; and it failed.&nbsp; In Wales, it was neither welcomed
nor opposed; it was simply tolerated, and with a bad grace.</p>
<p>For one thing, it brought English instead of Latin into public
worship.&nbsp; Latin, the old language of prayer and even of
sermon, was venerated, though not understood.&nbsp; But <a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>English was
not only not understood, it was also regarded as inferior to
Welsh.&nbsp; The Tudors&rsquo; dislike of various tongues was as
strong as their dislike of various jurisdictions.&nbsp; Henry
VIII., in giving Welshmen the Act of 1535, says that the tongue
of Owen Tudor is &ldquo;nothing like ne consonant to the natural
mother-tongue used within this realm,&rdquo; and enacts that all
officials in Wales shall speak English.&nbsp; And, in the same
spirit, the Welshman was told that the Kingdom of Heaven was now
open to him, but that he must seek it in English, or not at
all.</p>
<p>Again, the reformers&mdash;men of the type of Bishop
Barlow&mdash;despised and shocked a people they never
understood.&nbsp; The sanctity of St David&rsquo;s, the theme of
the best poets of the Middle Ages and the goal of generations of
pilgrims, was described by its Protestant bishop&mdash;who
unroofed the palace in order to get the lead&mdash;as a desolate
angle frequented only by vagabond pilgrims.&nbsp; A Welshman is
not appealed to by what is an insult to his country and a shock
to his religion at the same time.&nbsp; The relics were
ruthlessly swept away; they were taken possession of by the
agents of Cromwell and destroyed, or sent to London.&nbsp; The
images carried in the <a name="page88"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 88</span>village processions were
lost&mdash;the images that could keep the superstitious Welshman
from hell, or even bring him back from it, or heal his diseases,
or keep his cattle from the murrain, and his crops from
blight.&nbsp; I only know of one of those relics that can still
be seen.&nbsp; It is the healing cup of Nant Eos, a mere fragment
of wood.&nbsp; The people&rsquo;s faith in the relics can be
estimated from the fact that the cup has been used within the
last century.</p>
<p>Again, the monasteries were dissolved.&nbsp; The wealth of the
monasteries, their meadows and barns and sheep-runs and fish
ponds, were coveted by the rich; the poor thought of them as
sources of alms.&nbsp; The monks were good landlords; and they
gave freely, not only the comforts of religion, but of their
medicinal herbs and stores of food.&nbsp; The Welsh monasteries
were not so rich as those of England, and they were all dissolved
among the lesser monasteries&mdash;those with an income under
&pound;200 a year.&nbsp; But though none of them were very rich,
they nearly all had almost &pound;200 a year.&nbsp; Their loss
affected the whole country, as each part of Wales had one or two
of them&mdash;Tintern, Margam, Neath, and Whitland in the south;
Strata Florida, Cwm Hir, Ystrad Marchell, and the <a
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>Vanner in
central Wales; and Basingwerk and Maenan in the north.</p>
<p>The Reformation brought the poorer classes in Wales, not only
insults to their national and religious feelings, but material
loss.&nbsp; It appealed only to the English bishops who had
adopted the new Protestant tenets, and to the Welsh and English
landowners who had lost their reverence for relics, and had
learnt to hunger for land.</p>
<p>The movement was a severe strain on the loyalty of the
Welshman to the Tudors, but he had learnt to look to the king for
guidances and he suffered in silence.&nbsp; Mary was welcomed,
and no Welsh blood was shed for the Protestant faith.&nbsp; The
passive resistance to the Reformation might have broken out into
a rebellion if a leader had come.</p>
<p>In Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign two attempts were made to disturb
the religious settlement.&nbsp; One was made by the
Jesuits&mdash;the wonderful society established to check the
Reformation movement and to lead a reaction against it.&nbsp; In
1583 John Bennett came to North Wales; in 1595 Robert Jones came
to Raglan; and several Welsh Jesuits suffered martyrdom.&nbsp;
The other attempt was that of John Penry, who wished to appeal to
the intellect of the <a name="page90"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 90</span>people by means of the pulpit and the
printing press.&nbsp; The apostle of the new creed was crushed,
like those who wished to revive the old; he was put to death as a
traitor in 1593, after a short life of importunate pleading that
he might preach the Gospel in Wales.</p>
<p>Before the end of the reign of Elizabeth, however, the Welsh
language was recognised.&nbsp; The last school founded, that of
Ruthin in 1595, was to have a master who could teach and preach
in Welsh.&nbsp; And in 1588 there had appeared, by the help of
Archbishop Whitgift, the Welsh Bible of William Morgan.&nbsp; It
was the appearance of this Bible that aroused the first real
welcome to the Reformation.&nbsp; But the Reformation that gave
England a Spenser and a Shakespeare aroused no new life in Wales,
not a single hymn or a single prayer.</p>
<h2>XIX<br />
THE CIVIL WAR</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">After</span> the Tudors came the
Stuarts.&nbsp; The Tudors did what their people wanted; the <a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>king and the
people, between them, crushed the nobles.&nbsp; The Stuarts did
what they thought right, and they did not try to please the
people.&nbsp; Under the Tudors, there was harmony between Crown
and Parliament; and Elizabeth left a prosperous people with
strong views about their rights and their religion.&nbsp; But
James I., and especially his son Charles I., tried to change law
and religion.&nbsp; From the Tudor period of unity, then, we come
to the Stuart period of strife.</p>
<p>From 1603 to 1642 the struggle went on in Parliament.&nbsp;
The Welsh Members nearly all supported the king, and the Welsh
people followed the Welsh gentry in strong loyalty.&nbsp; The
most famous Welshman of the period was John Williams, who became
Archbishop of York and Lord Keeper.&nbsp; He was a wise man; he
saw that both sides were a little in the wrong; and if any one
could have kept the peace between them, he could have done
it.&nbsp; But the king did not quite trust him, and the
Parliament almost despised him; and this happens often to wise
men who get between two angry parties.</p>
<p>From 1642 to 1646, the First Civil War was waged.&nbsp; This
was a war between the king and the Parliament over taxation, <a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>militia, and
religion.&nbsp; The south-east, and London especially, were for
Parliament; the wilder parts, especially Wales, were for the
king.&nbsp; The only important part of Wales that declared for
Parliament was the southern part of Pembrokeshire, which had been
English ever since the reign of Henry II.</p>
<p>Wales was important to the king for two reasons.&nbsp; For one
thing, it could give him an army, and he came, time after time,
to get a new one.&nbsp; When he unfurled his flag and began the
war at Nottingham in 1642, he came to Shrewsbury, and there five
thousand Welshmen joined him.&nbsp; With these and others he
marched against London, fighting the battle of Edgehill on the
way.&nbsp; While the king made many attempts to get London until
1644, and while the New Model army attacked him between 1645 and
1647, the Welsh fought in nearly all his battles, their infantry
suffering heavily in the two greatest battles, Marston Moor and
Naseby.&nbsp; The war went on in Wales itself also&mdash;Rupert
and Gerard being the chief Royalist leaders, and Middleton and
Michael Jones being the chief Parliamentary ones.&nbsp; No great
battles were fought, but there were several skirmishes, and much
taking and retaking of castles and towns.</p>
<p><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>Wales
was important to the king, also, because it commanded the two
ways to Ireland.&nbsp; The King thought, almost to the last, that
an Irish army would save him.&nbsp; Welsh garrisons held the two
ports for Ireland, Chester and Bristol.&nbsp; Bristol was stormed
by a great midnight assault, and Chester was forced to
yield.&nbsp; In March 1647 Harlech yielded, and the war came to
an end.&nbsp; By that time the king was a prisoner in the hands
of the army.</p>
<p>The Second Civil War, in 1648 and 1649, was a struggle between
the two sections of the victorious army.&nbsp; The Parliament
wished to establish one religion, the army said that every man
must be allowed to worship God as he liked.&nbsp; One was called
the Presbyterian ideal, the other the Independent.&nbsp; The army
was led by Cromwell, and Parliament was overawed.&nbsp; Then the
Presbyterian parts rose in revolt&mdash;Kent, Pembrokeshire, and
the lowlands of Scotland.&nbsp; The New Model army marched
against the Welsh, in order to break the connection between the
northern and southern Presbyterians.&nbsp; The Welsh generals
were Laugharne, Poyer, and Powell, who had all fought for
Parliament in the first war.&nbsp; They were defeated at St
Fagans, near Cardiff, and then driven into Pembroke.&nbsp; <a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>They
determined to hold out to the last within its walls.&nbsp;
Cromwell besieged them, and the great feature of the war was the
siege of Pembroke.&nbsp; Walls and castles like those of Pembroke
had become useless because of gunpowder.&nbsp; But Cromwell could
not at once bring his guns so far.&nbsp; His difficulties were
increasing daily: the Parliament was trying to come to terms with
the king, all Wales around him was disaffected, the Scotch had
crossed the border and were marching on London.&nbsp; After many
weeks of assaults and desperate defence, the guns came and the
old walls were battered down.&nbsp; Pembroke Castle, whose great
round tower still stands, had protected William Marshall against
Llywelyn and had enabled an important district to remain a
&ldquo;little England beyond Wales,&rdquo; was the last
medi&aelig;val castle to take an important part in war.&nbsp; The
Scotch were soon defeated at the battle of Preston, and the king
was brought to trial and put to death, the death-warrant being
signed by two Welshmen&mdash;John Jones of Merioneth and Thomas
Wogan of Cardigan.&nbsp; The date of Charles&rsquo; execution is
January 20, 1649.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth was established immediately, and Wales was
looked upon with <a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
95</span>much distrust&mdash;the Presbyterian parts and the
Royalist parts&mdash;by the new Government.&nbsp; It was
represented in the English Parliaments, it is true, but its
representatives were often English, and practically appointed by
the Government.&nbsp; When the country was put under the military
dictatorship of the major-generals, Harrison was sent to rule
Wales.</p>
<p>Honest attempts were made to give it an efficient clergy; but
the zeal of Vavasour Powel aroused much opposition.&nbsp; Wales
either clung tenaciously to its old religion; or, if it changed
it, the changes were extreme.&nbsp; Though the country generally
returned to its old life and thought at the Restoration in 1660,
much of the new life of the Commonwealth remained: congregations
of Independents still met; Quaker ideals survived all
persecution; and even the mysticism of Morgan Lloyd permeated the
slowly awakening thought of the peasants whom, in his dreams, he
saw welcoming the second advent of Christ.</p>

THE GREAT REVOLUTION</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Except</span> to the reader who is of a
legal or antiquarian turn of mind, the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries are the least interesting in the history of
Wales&mdash;the very centuries that are the most glorious and the
most stirring in the history of England.&nbsp; The older
historians stop when they come to the year 1284, and sometimes
give a hasty outline of a few rebellions up to 1535.&nbsp; They
then give the Welsh a glowing testimonial as a law-abiding and
loyal people, and find them too uninteresting to write any more
about them.</p>
<p>The history of Wales does, indeed, appear to be nothing more
than the gradual disappearance of Welsh institutions.&nbsp; The
Court of Wales was restored with the king in 1660; but its work
had been done, and it came to an end in 1689.&nbsp; The Great
Sessions came to an end in 1830; and, though we now see that
their disappearance was a mistake, the bill abolishing them
passed <a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
97</span>through Parliament without a division.&nbsp; The last
difference between England and Wales was deleted; and if Wales
has no separate existence left, why should we write or read its
history?</p>
<p>Because the two centuries of apparent settlement and sleep
were the period of a silent revolution, more important, if our
aim is to explain the living present rather than the dead past,
than all the exciting plots and battles of the House of Cunedda
from the rise of Maelgwn to the fall of the last Llywelyn.&nbsp;
During these centuries, the history of Wales ceases to be the
history of princes and nobles, it becomes the history of the
people.&nbsp; Owen Glendower&rsquo;s few years of power were a
kind of prophecy; but Owen once appeared to the abbot of Valle
Crucis, so tradition says, to declare that he had come before his
time.&nbsp; We pass then, very gradually, from the history of a
privileged class, speaking literary Welsh, with a literature
famous for the wealth of its imagination and the artistic beauty
of its form&mdash;we pass on to the history of a peasantry, rude
and ignorant at first, retaining the servile traits of centuries
of subjection, but gradually becoming self-reliant, prosperous,
and thoughtful.</p>
<p><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>The
real history of a nation is shown by its literature.&nbsp; Its
records and its chronicles are but the notes and comments of
various ages.&nbsp; In the period of the princes and nobles, you
can trace the rise and decline of a great literature; watch how
it gathers strength and beauty from Cynddelw to Dafydd ap Gwilym,
and how the strength begins to fail and the beauty to wane, from
Dafydd ap Gwilym to Tudur Aled.&nbsp; In the period of the
people, from Tudor times on, the peasants tried at first to
imitate the poetry of the past; then they began to write and
think in their own way.&nbsp; It is not my aim to explain the
periods of Welsh literature now; I am going to do that in another
book.&nbsp; But, as I have mentioned three typical poets in the
period of the princes, I will also mention three poets in the
period of the people.</p>
<p>In 1579 Rees Prichard was born; in 1717, Williams Pant y
Celyn; in 1832, Islwyn.&nbsp; We have, in these three, writers
typical of the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries
respectively.&nbsp; Rees Prichard, still affectionately
remembered in every Welsh home as the &ldquo;Old Vicar,&rdquo;
wrote stanzas in the dialect of the Vale of Towy&mdash;rough,
full of peasant phrases and mangled English <a
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>words; and he
wrote them, not in books, but on the memory of the people.&nbsp;
In the same valley, a century later, Williams Pant y Celyn wrote
hymns, melodious and inspiring, of great poetic beauty, though
with a trace of dialect; they were written and published, but
they also haunted every ear that heard them.&nbsp; Beyond the
Black Mountains, in the hills of West Monmouth, after another
century, Islwyn wrote odes without a trace of dialect; they were
written and remained for some time in manuscript; when published,
they met with a welcome which shows clearly that Islwyn is the
typical poet of modern Welsh thought.&nbsp; If you wish to see
and realise the rise of the Welsh peasant, pass from the homely
stanzas of the good Old Vicar&rsquo;s <i>Welshmen&rsquo;s
Candle</i> to the poetic theology of Pant y Celyn, and from that
to the poetic philosophy of Islwyn, where concentrated intensity
of thought is expressed in a style that is, at any rate at its
best, superior to the best work of the poets of the princes.</p>
<p>If I were to tell you the reasons for this change, I would be
writing, in a slightly different form, what I have already
written in this book about early Welsh history.&nbsp; The fall of
Llywelyn, the Black Death, <a name="page100"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 100</span>Owen Glendower&rsquo;s ideals and
the Tudor legislation, all prepared the way.</p>
<p>The long-bow and gunpowder, we have seen, made the peasant as
important as the noble in war.&nbsp; The long-bow made the coat
of mail useless, gunpowder made the castle useless&mdash;the
defence of the privileges of the Middle Ages departed.</p>
<p>Ideas of equality were advanced.&nbsp; They were looked upon
at first as truths applicable only to a perfect and impossible
condition, and their discoverers were ignored, if not hanged or
burnt.&nbsp; But they always became a reality, and were
victorious in the end.&nbsp; Take the truths discovered or
championed by Welshmen.&nbsp; Walter Brute rediscovered the
theory of justification by faith&mdash;that all men are equal in
the sight of God, and that no lord could be responsible for
them.&nbsp; Bishop Pecock advocated the doctrine of
toleration&mdash;that reason, not persecution, should rule.&nbsp;
John Penry claimed that the people had a right to discuss
publicly the questions that vitally affected them.&nbsp; The
history of the past shows that the apostles were condemned, the
life of the present shows that their ideas lived.</p>
<p>Industry and commerce became more free.&nbsp; In Tudor times
piracy was repressed, <a name="page101"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 101</span>the march lordships were abolished,
the privileges of the towns ceased to fetter manufacture, trade
with England became free.&nbsp; In Stuart times roads were made,
the industries depending on wool revived, and the industries of
Britain began to move westwards towards the iron and the
coal.&nbsp; In the Hanoverian period waste lands were enclosed,
the slate mines of the north and the coal pits of the south were
opened.</p>
<p>The Tudors succeeded in getting the upper classes to speak
English, and to turn their backs on Welsh life.&nbsp; The peasant
was left supreme: he knew not what to do at first, but light soon
came.</p>
<p>Pass through Wales, and you will see the life of both
periods&mdash;the ruined castles and the ruined monasteries of
the old; the quarries and pits, the towns and ports, the churches
and chapels, the schools and colleges of the present.</p>

HOWEL HARRIS</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is difficult to write about
religion without giving offence.&nbsp; Religion will come into
politics, and must come into history.&nbsp; It has given much,
perhaps most, of its strength to modern Wales; it has given it
many, if not most, of its political difficulties.</p>
<p>There are periods of religious calm and periods of religious
fervour in the life of every nation.&nbsp; I do not know whether
it is necessary, but it is certainly the fact&mdash;the two
periods condemn each other with great energy.&nbsp; With regard
to creed&mdash;the life of religion&mdash;you will find that the
periods of energy tend to be Calvinistic&mdash;an intense belief
that man is a mere instrument in the hands of God, working out
plans he does not understand; while in periods of rest it tends
to be Arminian&mdash;a comfortable belief that man sees his
future clearly, and that he can guide it as he likes.&nbsp; With
regard to the Church&mdash;the body of religion&mdash;it is
fortunate, in times of calm, if it is established, to keep the
spirit of religion <a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>alive; it is fortunate, in times of fervour, if it is
free, in order that the new life may give it a more perfect
shape.</p>
<p>Now we must remember that there can be no calm without a
little indifference, and that there can be no enthusiasm without
a little intolerance.&nbsp; So men call each other fanatics and
bigots and hypocrites, because they have not taken the trouble to
realise that there is much variety in human character and in the
workings of the human mind.&nbsp; Perhaps it is also worth
remembering that an institution is not placed at the mercy of a
reformer, but gradually changed.</p>
<p>The eighteenth century was a century of indifference in
religion in Wales, the nineteenth century was a century of
enthusiasm.&nbsp; The Church at the beginning of the eighteenth
century, at any rate as far as the higher clergy were concerned,
was apathetic to religion, and alive only to selfish
interests.&nbsp; The Whig bishops were appointed for political
reasons; they hated the Tory principles of the Welsh squires, and
they neglected and despised the Welsh people they had never tried
to understand.&nbsp; In England, the Defoes and the Swifts of
literature were encouraged and utilised by the political parties;
in Wales, where clergymen <a name="page104"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 104</span>were the only writers, the Whig
bishops distrusted them, and silenced them where they could,
because they wrote Welsh.&nbsp; The Church did not show more
misapplication of revenue than the State, perhaps; but, while the
people could not leave the State as a protest against corruption,
they could leave the Church.&nbsp; And, during the middle of the
eighteenth century, a great national awakening began.</p>
<p>The trumpet blast of the awakening was Howel Harris.&nbsp; He
was a Breconshire peasant, of strong passion which became
sanctified by a life-long struggle, of devouring ambition which
he nearly succeeded in taming to a life of intense service to
God.&nbsp; Many bitter things have been said about him, but
nothing more bitter than he has said about himself in the volumes
of prayers and recriminations he wrote to torture his own soul,
and to goad himself into harder work.&nbsp; The fame of his
eloquence filled the land, and districts expected his appearance
anxiously, as in old times they expected Owen Glendower.&nbsp;
Howel Harris was, however, no political agitator.&nbsp; He had an
imperious will, and he wished to rule his brethren; he was
aggressive and military in spirit; God to him was the Lord of
Hosts; <a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>he preached the gospel of peace in the uniform of an
officer of the militia, and he sent many of his converts to fight
abroad in the battles of the century.&nbsp; He had a love of
organisation; he established at Trevecca what was partly a
religious community, and partly a co-operative manufacturing
company.&nbsp; But, wherever he stood to proclaim the wrath of
God, no shower of stones or condemnation of minister or justice
could make those who heard him forget him, or believe that what
he said was wrong.</p>
<p>If I were writing for antiquarians, and not for those who read
history in order to see why things are now as they are, I would
write details&mdash;important and instructive&mdash;about the
Church of the eighteenth century, and about the congregations of
Dissenters which the seventeenth century handed over to the
eighteenth to persecute and despise.&nbsp; The Independents and
Baptists sturdily maintained their principles of religious
liberty, but they found the century a stiff-necked one, and their
congregations were content with merely existing.&nbsp; The
Quakers maintained that war was wrong while Britain passed
through war fever after war fever&mdash;the Seven Years&rsquo;
War and the wars against <a name="page106"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 106</span>Napoleon.&nbsp; Howel Harris&rsquo;
voice might have been a voice crying in the wilderness, if it had
not been for the spiritual life of the existing congregations,
conformist and dissenting.&nbsp; Modern ideas in Wales have been
profoundly affected by the Quakers, and especially in districts
from which, as a sect, they have long passed away.</p>
<p>The voice of Howel Harris called all these to a new life; and
it is about that new life, in the variety given it by all the
different actors in it, that I want you to think now.&nbsp; It
made preaching necessary, for one thing; and it was followed by a
century of great pulpit oratory.&nbsp; It profoundly affected
literature.&nbsp; It gave Wales, to begin with, a hymn literature
that no country in the world has surpassed.&nbsp; The contrast
between the Reformation and the Revival is very
striking&mdash;one gave the people a Church government
established by law and a literature of translations, the other
gave it institutions of its own making and original living
thought.&nbsp; The Revival gave literature in every branch a new
strength and greater wealth.</p>
<p>It created a demand for education.&nbsp; Griffith Jones of
Llanddowror established a system of circulating schools, the
teachers moving <a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span>from place to place as a room was offered
them&mdash;sometimes a church and sometimes a barn.&nbsp; Charles
of Bala established a system of Sunday Schools, and the whole
nation gradually joined it.&nbsp; The Press became active,
newspapers appeared.&nbsp; It became quite clear that a new life
throbbed in the land.</p>
<h2>XXII<br />
THE REFORM ACTS</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> new life brought an inevitable
demand for a share in the government of the country, and this
brought the old order and the new face to face.&nbsp; The
political power was entirely in the hands of the squires,
alienated from the peasants in many cases by a difference of
language, and in most cases by a difference of religion.</p>
<p>The Act of 1535 had, as we have seen, given Wales a
representation in Parliament.&nbsp; Each shire had one member
only; except Monmouth, which had two.&nbsp; Each shire town had
one member, except that of Merioneth; and Haverfordwest was given
<a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>a
member.&nbsp; The county franchise was the forty shilling
freehold; it therefore excluded not only those who had no
connection with the land, but the copyholder&mdash;who was really
a landowner, but whose tenure was regarded as base, on account of
his villein origin.&nbsp; This copyholder was undoubtedly the
descendant of the Welsh serf of medi&aelig;val times.</p>
<p>The first Reform Act, that of 1832, was won for the great
manufacturing towns of England, but Wales benefited by it.&nbsp;
It extended the franchise to the copyholder, and to the farmer
paying &pound;50 rent, in the counties; it gave the towns a
uniform &pound;10 household franchise.&nbsp; It also brought many
of the towns into the system of representation.&nbsp; It raised
the number of members from twenty-seven to thirty-two; the
agricultural districts getting two, and the mining districts
two.</p>
<p>The slight change in representation is a recognition of the
growing industries of the country, especially in the coal and
iron districts.&nbsp; The coal of the great coalfield of South
Wales had been worked as far back as Norman times; but it was in
the nineteenth century that the coal and iron industries of South
Wales, and the coal <a name="page110"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 110</span>and slate industries of North Wales
became important.&nbsp; Cardiff, Swansea, and Newport became
important ports; and places that few had ever heard of
before&mdash;like Ystradyfodwg or Blaenau Ffestiniog&mdash;became
the centres of important industries.&nbsp; But, in 1832, Wales
was still mainly pastoral and agricultural; and the Act, though
it did much for the towns, left the representation of the
counties in the hands of the same class.&nbsp; Still, it was the
towns that showed disappointment, as was seen in the Chartism of
the wool district of Llanidloes and of the coal district of
Newport.</p>
<p>The second Reform Act, of 1867, gave Merthyr Tydvil two
representatives instead of one, otherwise it left the
distribution of seats as it had been before.&nbsp; But the new
extension of the franchise&mdash;to the borough householder, the
borough &pound;10 lodger, and especially the &pound;12 tenant
farmer&mdash;gave new classes political power.&nbsp; It was
followed by a fierce struggle between the old landed gentry and
their tenants, a struggle which was moderated to a certain extent
by the Ballot Act of 1870, and by the great migration of the
country population to the slate and coal districts.</p>
<p>The rapid rise of the importance of the <a
name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>industrial
districts is seen in the third Reform Act of 1885.&nbsp; The
country districts represented by the small boroughs of the
agricultural counties of Brecon, Cardigan, Pembroke, and
Anglesey, were wholly or partly disfranchised.&nbsp; But the
slate county of Carnarvonshire had an additional member; and in
the coal and iron country, Swansea and Carmarthenshire and
Monmouthshire had one additional member each, and Glamorgan
three.</p>
<p>The third Reform Act enfranchised the agricultural labourer
and the country artisan.&nbsp; In England many doubts were
expressed about the intelligence or the colour of the politics of
the new voter; but, in Wales, most would admit that he was as
intelligent as any voter enfranchised before him; all knew there
could be no doubt about his politics.</p>
<p>The character of the representation of Wales has entirely
changed.&nbsp; The squire gave place to the capitalist, and the
capitalist to popular leaders.&nbsp; Wales, whose people blindly
followed the gentry in the Great Civil War, is now the most
democratic part of Britain.</p>
<h2><a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>XXIII<br />
EDUCATION</h2>
<p>The chief feature of the history of Wales during the
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries is the growth of a system of
education.</p>
<p>The most democratic, the most perfect, and the most efficient
method is still that of the Sunday School.&nbsp; It was well
established before the death of Charles of Bala, whose name is
most closely connected with it, in 1814.&nbsp; It soon became,
and it still remains, a school for the whole people, from
children to patriarchs.&nbsp; Its language is that of its
district.&nbsp; Its teachers are selected for
efficiency&mdash;they are easily shifted to the classes which
they can teach best; and, if not successful, they go back
willingly to the &ldquo;teachers&rsquo; class,&rdquo; where all
are equal.&nbsp; The reputation of a good Sunday School teacher
is still the highest degree that can be won in Wales.&nbsp;
Plentiful text books of high merit, and an elaborate system of
oral and written examinations, mark the last stage in its
development.</p>
<p>The Literary Meeting is a kind of secular Sunday School.&nbsp;
The rules of alliterative <a name="page113"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 113</span>poetry and the study of Welsh
literature and history, and sometimes of more general knowledge,
take the place of the study of Jewish history, and psalm, and
gospel.&nbsp; The Literary Meetings feed the Eisteddvod.</p>
<p>The Eisteddvod passed through the same phases as the
nation.&nbsp; It was an aspect of the court of the prince during
the Middle Ages.&nbsp; In Tudor times it was used partly to
please the people, but chiefly to regulate the bards by forcing
them to qualify for a degree&mdash;a sure method of moderating
their patriotism and of diminishing their number.&nbsp; In modern
times the Eisteddvod is a great democratic meeting, and it is the
most characteristic of all Welsh institutions.&nbsp; Its chairing
of the bards is an ancient ceremony; its <i>gorsedd</i> of bards
is probably modern.&nbsp; But the people themselves still remain
the judges of poetry; they care very little whether a poet has
won a chair or not, while a <i>gorsedd</i> degree probably does
him more harm than good.</p>
<p>Elementary education, in its modern sense, began with the
circulating schools of Griffith Jones of Llanddowror in
1730.&nbsp; They were exceedingly successful because the
instruction was given in Welsh, and they stopped after teaching
150,000 to read not because there <a name="page114"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 114</span>was no demand for them, but on
account of a dispute about their endowments in 1779, eighteen
years after Griffith Jones&rsquo; death.&nbsp; They were followed
by voluntary schools, very often kept by illiterate teachers.</p>
<p>Between 1846 and 1848 two organisations&mdash;the Welsh
Education Committee and the Cambrian Society&mdash;were formed;
and they developed, respectively, the national schools and the
British schools.&nbsp; After the Education Act of 1870, the
schools became voluntary or Board; education gradually became
compulsory and free; and in 1902 an attempt was made to give the
whole system a unity and to connect it with the ordinary system
of local government.</p>
<p>The training of teachers became a matter of the highest
importance.&nbsp; In 1846 a college for this purpose was
established at Brecon, and then removed to Swansea.&nbsp; From
1848 to 1862, colleges were established at Carmarthen, Carnarvon,
and Bangor.</p>
<p>The history of secondary education is longer.&nbsp; It was
served, after the dissolution of the monasteries, by endowed
schools&mdash;like that of the Friars at Bangor&mdash;and by
proprietary schools.&nbsp; By the Education Act of 1889, a
complete system of secondary schools, under popular control, was
established.&nbsp; Two <a name="page115"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 115</span>of the endowed schools still
remain&mdash;Brecon, founded by the religionists of the
Reformation, and Llandovery, the Welsh school founded by a
patriot of modern times.</p>
<p>It was principally for the ministry of religion that secondary
schools and colleges were first established.&nbsp; Schools were
founded in many districts, and important colleges at Lampeter
(degree-granting), Carmarthen, Brecon, Bala, Trevecca, Pontypool,
Llangollen, Haverfordwest.&nbsp; Many of these have a long
history.</p>
<p>Higher education had been the dream of many centuries.&nbsp;
Owen Glendower had thought of establishing two new universities
at the beginning of the period of the Revival of Letters; among
his supporters were many of the Welsh students who led in the
great faction fights of medi&aelig;val Oxford.&nbsp; Oliver
Cromwell and Richard Baxter had thought of Welsh higher
education.&nbsp; But nothing was done.&nbsp; In the eighteenth
century, and in the nineteenth until 1870, the Test Act shut the
doors of the old Universities to most Welshmen; the new
University of London did not teach, it only examined; the Scotch
Universities, to which Welsh students crowded, were very
far.&nbsp; In 1872, chiefly through the exertions of Sir Hugh <a
name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>Owen, the
University College of Wales was opened at Aberystwyth, and
maintained for ten years by support from the people.&nbsp; The
Government helped, and two new colleges were added&mdash;the
University College of South Wales at Cardiff in 1883, and the
University College of North Wales at Bangor in 1884.&nbsp; In
1893 Queen Victoria gave a charter which formed the three
colleges into the University of Wales.&nbsp; Lord Aberdare, its
first Chancellor, lived to see it in thorough working
order.&nbsp; On Lord Aberdare&rsquo;s death, the Prince of Wales
was elected Chancellor in 1896; and when he ascended the throne
in 1901, the present Prince of Wales became Chancellor.</p>
<p>The tendency of the whole system of Welsh education is towards
greater unity.&nbsp; There is a dual government of the secondary
schools and of the colleges, the one by the Central Board and the
other by the University Court&mdash;a historical accident which
is now a blemish on the system.&nbsp; The Training Colleges are
still outside the University, but they are gravitating rapidly
towards it.&nbsp; The theological colleges are necessarily
independent, but the University offers their students a course in
arts, so that they can specialise on theology and its <a
name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>kindred
subjects.&nbsp; The ideal system is: an efficient and patriotic
University regulating the whole work of the secondary and
elementary schools, guided by the willingness of the County
Councils, or of an education authority appointed by them, to
provide means.</p>
<p>The rise of the educational system is the most striking and
the most interesting chapter in Welsh history.&nbsp; But the
facts are so numerous and the development is so sudden that, in
spite of one, it becomes a mere list of acts and dates.</p>
<h2>XXIV<br />
LOCAL GOVERNMENT</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> French Revolution was condemned
by Britain, and the voices raised in its favour in Wales were
few.&nbsp; The excesses of the Revolution, and the widespread
fear of a Napoleonic invasion, caused a strong reaction against
progress.&nbsp; The years immediately after were years of great
suffering, but the very suffering prepared the way for the
progress of the future, because it made men <a
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>willing to
leave their own districts and to move into the coal and slate
districts, where wages were high enough to enable them to
live.</p>
<p>The first demand was for political enfranchisement.&nbsp; In
1832, in 1867, and in 1884 the franchise was extended, and every
interest found a voice in Parliament.&nbsp; But, with the
exception of the sharp struggle between the tenant and landlord
after the Reform Act of 1867, the effects of enfranchisement on
Wales have been very few.&nbsp; Two Acts alone have been passed
as purely Welsh Acts&mdash;the Sunday Closing Act, and the
Intermediate Education Act.&nbsp; In Parliament, the voice of
Wales is weak even though unanimous; it can be outvoted by the
capital or by four English provincial towns.&nbsp; Until quite
recently its semi-independence&mdash;due to geography and past
history&mdash;was looked upon as a source of weakness to the
Empire rather than of strength.&nbsp; Its love for the past
appeals to the one political party, its desire for progress to
the other, but its distinctive ideals and its separate language
are looked upon, at the very least, as political
misfortunes.&nbsp; Education and justice have suffered from
official want of toleration; the appointment of a County Court
judge who <a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
119</span>could not speak Welsh, within living memory, has been
justified by Government on the ground that Englishmen resident in
Wales object to being tried by a Welsh judge.</p>
<p>Far more important to Wales than the Reform Acts are the Local
Government Acts which followed them.&nbsp; When the Reform Act of
1884 added the agricultural labourer to the electors of
representatives in Parliament, every interest had a voice.&nbsp;
A further extension of the franchise would not affect the balance
of parties, it was thought; and a British Parliament has no time
or desire to think of sentiment or theoretical perfection.&nbsp;
The Parliament found it had too much to do, the multiplicity of
interests made it impossible to pay effective attention to
them.&nbsp; The result has been that half a century of extension
of the franchise has been followed by half a century of extension
of local government.&nbsp; The County Council Act came in 1888,
and the Local Government Act in 1894.</p>
<p>Of all parts of Britain, Wales had least local government, and
needed most.&nbsp; Its justices of the peace were alien in
religion, race, and sympathy; they were either country squires
who had lost touch with the people, or English and Scotch
capitalists who, with <a name="page120"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 120</span>rare exceptions, took no trouble to
understand the people they governed, or to learn their
language.&nbsp; The vestry meeting had been active enough during
the early part of the eighteenth century; but religious
difficulties made it impossible for a semi-ecclesiastical
institution to represent a parish.&nbsp; The Tudor policy had
separated the people from the greater land-owners; the iron
masters and coal-owners had not yet become part of the people;
there was not a single institution except the Eisteddvod where
all classes met.</p>
<p>In no part of the country was local government so warmly
welcomed, and no part of the country was more ready for it.&nbsp;
One thing the peasants had been allowed to do&mdash;they could
build schools and colleges, churches and chapels.&nbsp; They had
filled the country with these&mdash;their architecture, finance,
government, are those of the peasant.&nbsp; The religious
revivals had left organisers and institutions.&nbsp; Four or five
religious bodies had a system of institutions&mdash;parish,
district, county, central.&nbsp; All these were thoroughly
democratic in character.&nbsp; When the Local Government Acts
were passed, there was hardly a Welshman of full age and average
ability who had not been a <a name="page121"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 121</span>delegate or in authority; and those
of striking ability, if they could afford the time, continually
sat in some little council or other and watched over the
interests of some institution.</p>
<p>It was from among these trained men that the councillors for
the new county, district, and parish senates were elected.&nbsp;
The work of the councils, especially that of the County Council,
has been very difficult; and when the time comes to write their
history, the historian will have to set himself to explain why
the first councils were served by men who had extraordinary tact
for government and great skill in financial matters.&nbsp; In the
lower councils the village Hampden&rsquo;s eloquence is modified
by the chilling responsibility for the rates, but the Parish
Councils have already, in many places, made up for the negligence
of generations of sleepy magistrates and officials.</p>
<p>With a great difference, it is true, Wales under local
government is Wales back again in the times of the princes.&nbsp;
The parish is roughly the maenol, the district is the commote or
the cantrev, the shire is the little kingdom&mdash;like
Ceredigion or Morgannwg&mdash;which fought so sturdily against
any attempt to subject it.</p>
<p><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>The
local councils were fortunate in the time of their
appearance.&nbsp; They came at a period characterised by an
intense desire for a better system of education, and at a time of
rapidly growing prosperity.&nbsp; A heavy rate was possible, and
the people were willing to bear it.&nbsp; The County Councils
were able to build over seventy intermediate schools within a few
years; and that at a time when both elementary and higher
education made heavy demands on what was still a comparatively
poor county.&nbsp; The District Councils were able to lower the
amount of outdoor relief considerably, and without causing any
real hardship, for they had knowledge of their districts as well
as the philanthropy that comes naturally to man when he grants
other people&rsquo;s money.&nbsp; The Parish Councils have become
the guardians of public paths; they have begun to provide parish
libraries, and the little parish senate educates its constituency
and brings its wisdom to bear upon a number of practical
questions, such as cottage gardens and fairs.</p>

123</span>XXV<br />
THE WALES OF TO-DAY</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> most striking characteristic of
the Wales of to-day is its unity&mdash;self-conscious and
self-reliant.&nbsp; The presence of this unity is felt by all,
though it may be explained in different ways.&nbsp; It cannot be
explained by race; for the population of the west midlands and
the north of England, possibly of the whole of it, have been made
up of the same elements.&nbsp; It cannot be explained by
language&mdash;nearly one half of the Welsh people speak no
Welsh.&nbsp; Some attribute it to the inexorable laws of
geography and climate, others to the fatalism of history.&nbsp;
Others frivolously put it down to modern football.&nbsp; But no
one who knows Wales is ignorant of it.</p>
<p>The modern unity of the Welsh people&mdash;seen occasionally
in a function of the University, or at a national Eisteddvod, or
in a conference of the County Councils&mdash;has become a fact in
spite of many difficulties.</p>
<p>One difficulty has been the absence of a capital.&nbsp; The

extreme south; the National Library is at Aberystwyth, on the
western sea.&nbsp; The thriving industries, the densely populated
districts, and the frequent and active railways, are in the
extreme south or in the extreme north; and they are separated by
five or six shires of pastures and sheep-runs, without large
towns, and with comparatively few railways.&nbsp; In the three
southern counties&mdash;Glamorgan, Monmouth, and
Carmarthen&mdash;the population is between two and six people to
10 acres, and the industrial population is from twelve to three
times the number of the agricultural.&nbsp; In the central
counties&mdash;Brecon, Radnor, Cardigan, Merioneth,
Montgomery&mdash;the population is below one for 10 acres; the
industrial and agricultural population are about equal, except in
Radnor, where the agricultural is more than two to one.&nbsp;
Though Merioneth has more sheep even than Brecon&mdash;and each
of them has nearly 400,000&mdash;its industrial population, owing
to the slate districts, is double the agricultural.&nbsp; The
population begins to thicken again as we get nearer the slate,
limestone, and coal districts.&nbsp; In Denbigh it is two to the
10 acres, in Carnarvon it is three, and in Flint it rises to four
or five.&nbsp; In these northern <a name="page125"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 125</span>counties the industrial population
is double or treble the agricultural.&nbsp; The fertile western
counties of Pembroke and Anglesey come between the industrial and
grazing counties in density of population. <a
name="citation4"></a><a href="#footnote4"
class="citation">[4]</a></p>
<p>Unity has arisen in spite of differences caused by the
intensity of a religious revival, an intensity that periodically
renews its strength.&nbsp; The Welsh are divided into sects, and
the bitterness of sectarian differences occasionally invades
politics and education.&nbsp; But there are two ever-present
antidotes.&nbsp; One is the Welsh sense of humour, the nearest
relative or the best friend of toleration.&nbsp; The other is the
hymn&mdash;creed has been turned into song, and that is at least
half way to turning it into life; the heresy hunter is disarmed
by the poetry of the hymn, and its music has charms to soothe the
sectarian breast.&nbsp; The co-operation of all in the work of
local government has also enlarged sympathy.</p>
<p>Unity has arisen in spite of the bilingual <a
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
126</span>difficulty.&nbsp; Rather more than one half of the
people now habitually speak English.&nbsp; For three centuries an
Act&mdash;a dead letter from the beginning&mdash;ordered all
Government officials to speak English; for many generations,
until recently, Welsh children were not taught Welsh in schools,
and they could not be taught English.&nbsp; The bilingual
difficulty is now at an end.&nbsp; The two languages are taught
in the schools, and as living languages.&nbsp; It is clear, on
the one hand, that every one should learn English, the language
of the Empire and of commerce.&nbsp; It is also clear that, on
account of its own beauty as well as that of the great literature
it enshrines, Welsh should be taught in every school throughout
Wales.</p>
<p>Next to its unity, a characteristic of modern Wales is its
democratic feeling.&nbsp; It is a country with a thoughtful and
intelligent peasantry, and it is a country without a middle
class.&nbsp; There is a very small upper class&mdash;the old
Welsh land-owning families who once, before they turned their
backs on Welsh literature, led the country.&nbsp; They have never
been hated or despised, they are simply ignored.&nbsp; Their
tendency now is to come into touch with the people, and they are
always welcomed.&nbsp; But a middle class, <a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>in the
English sense, does not exist.&nbsp; The wealthier industrial
class is bound by the closest ties of sympathy to the farmer and
labourer.&nbsp; The farmer&rsquo;s holding is generally
small&mdash;from 50 to 250 acres&mdash;and he always treats his
servants and labourers as equals.</p>
<p>The three great levelling causes&mdash;religion, industry, <a
name="citation5"></a><a href="#footnote5"
class="citation">[5]</a> and education&mdash;have been at work in
Wales in recent years.&nbsp; Education helps and is helped by
equality.&nbsp; In town and country alike all Welsh children
attend the same schools&mdash;elementary and secondary; and they
proceed, those that do proceed, to the same University, and a
university is essentially a levelling institution.&nbsp; The
dialects, as well as the literary language, are recognised; and
no dialect has a stigma.&nbsp; In this respect Wales is more like
Scotland than England.</p>
<p>There is one other characteristic of modern Wales&mdash;a
certain pride, not so much in what has been done, but in what is
going to be done.&nbsp; Wales is small, though not much smaller
than Palestine, or Holland, or Switzerland, and every part of it
knows the other.&nbsp; <a name="page128"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 128</span>There is a healthy rivalry between
its towns and between its colleges; each town can show that it
has done something for Wales in the past&mdash;by means of its
industries, or school, or press.&nbsp; In the strong feeling of
unity there is ambition to surpass, and each part lives in the
light of the action of the other parts.</p>
<p>The day is a day of incessant activity&mdash;industrial,
educational, literary, and political.&nbsp; What is true in the
life of the individual is true in the life of a nation&mdash;a
day of hard work is a happy day and a day of hope.</p>

OUTLINE OF WELSH POLITICAL HISTORY</h2>
<h3>INFLUENCES UNDER WHICH THE HISTORY OF WALES WAS FORMED</h3>
<p>1.&nbsp; The nature of its rocks&mdash;Igneous, Cambrian,
Silurian, Old Red Sandstone, Limestone, Coal&mdash;all belonging
to the Primary Period.&nbsp; Its rocks</p>
<p class="gutindent">(<i>a</i>)&nbsp; explain its scenery;</p>
<p class="gutindent">(<i>b</i>)&nbsp; explain its wealth, the
richest part of Britain in minerals.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The configuration of its surface.</p>
<p class="gutindent">(<i>a</i>)&nbsp; It is isolated, its
mountains being surrounded by the sea, or rising sharply from the
plains.&nbsp; It is part of the range of mountains which runs
along the whole of the west coast of Britain; but the range is
broken at the mouth of the Severn and at the mouth of the
Dee.</p>
<p class="gutindent">(<i>b</i>)&nbsp; It is divided, its valleys
and roads radiating in all directions.&nbsp; So we have in its
history</p>
<p class="gutindent">A.&nbsp; Wars of Independence.</p>
<p class="gutindent">B.&nbsp; Civil War.</p>
<h3>THE PEOPLE WHO CAME INTO WALES</h3>
<p>1.&nbsp; The Iberians&mdash;a general name for the short dark
people who still form the greater part of the nations.&nbsp; They
had stone weapons, and lived in tribes; they became subject to
later invaders, but gradually became free.&nbsp; Their language
is lost.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The Celts&mdash;a tall fair-haired race, speaking an
Aryan tongue.&nbsp; It was their migration that was stopped by
the rise of Rome.&nbsp; Four <a name="page130"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 130</span>groups of mountains, four nations
(Celtic and Iberian), four medi&aelig;val kingdoms, and four
modern dioceses can be remembered thus:</p>

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily

same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no

  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from

  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
